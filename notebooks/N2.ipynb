    "## What is MediaCloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Media Cloud](https://www.mediacloud.org) is an open-source media research project, enabling the study of news and information flow globally. The project is administered as a consortium collaboration between the Media Ecosystems Analysis Group, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Northeastern University. It was originally incubated at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, it is a platform that **collects** and analyzes news articles from various sources, allowing researchers to study media trends, narratives, and the spread of information over time. It provides tools for data collection, text analysis, and visualization, making it a valuable resource for journalists, academics, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Media Cloud is **not** a repository of news articles. Instead, it provides **metadata** and **text analysis** of articles collected from various sources. The actual articles themselves are not stored within Media Cloud; rather, the platform focuses on analyzing the content and patterns within the media landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Media Cloud API\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interact with Media Cloud either through their web interface or programmatically using their API. The API allows you to query the Media Cloud database, retrieve metadata about articles, and perform various analyses. In general, there are two main components of the Media Cloud API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Media Cloud API: Search Against Media Cloud's new Online News Archive, with access to 200 million+ stories and growing every day. Search against hundreds of sources and collections we have developed.\n",
    "2. Wayback Machine: Search against the Wayback Machine’s database through an API we developed to be able to search against the large number of sources and collections we have developed. Search is against the title text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on the Media Cloud API. However, first, we will start by briefly exploring the web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up an Account\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Media Cloud API, you need to set up an account and obtain an API key. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit the [Media Cloud website](https://www.mediacloud.org) and sign up for an account.\n",
    "2. Once you are logged in, navigate to your profile settings and press Request API Access (see the image below).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"png/mediacloud_api.png\" /></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After requesting access, you will receive an email with a link to confirm your API access. Click the link to confirm.\n",
    "4. Once confirmed, you can find your API key in your profile settings (see the image below).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"png/mediacloud_api_key.png\" /></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture above, I hid some information because those are the credentials (API Key) you will use to tell Media Cloud who you are. You should never share them with anyone, even your spouse or a firefighter! That is because they serve to identify you. If someone maluses them, it will be on you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Storing your credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to store your credentials and passwords safely. We don't want them to be corrupted, right? However, it is one thing to store them [safely](https://youtu.be/MnjQV--o1-0?si=hIlgl9sCyt4JhVUd) and the other to have [strong passwords](https://youtu.be/mQ36sUT77qI?si=hxRw4O4UxKM_WUPy). We all know that we should use strong passwords, but do we really know why? The picture below shows how fast one can crack your password depending on its complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"png/password_table_2023.jpg\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhow, the lesson we should take from the graph above is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use strong passwords.\n",
    "2. Use password managers to propose strong passwords and store them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for any reason, you are still reluctant to trust password managers, at least create complex passwords by mixing nonsense words (it is the only place where making spelling errors helps) and special characters, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`$eating#keyborads-1ncreases_staminA`\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have already generated passwords and credentials that look pretty strong. How are we going to store them?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environmental variables\n",
    "\n",
    "As you probably rightly suspect, in our case, we will need our credentials to connect to the API. We don't really want to store them in the notebook because we want to be able to share the notebook (you want to share it with me, and I want to share it with you). We don't want to copy and paste them every time we want to use the notebook, cause it would be very inefficient. Also, it will be quite easy to forget about it. What are we going to do then?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use something called environmental variables. In other words, we are going to define some variables either on our computer or in the Colab that will be stored there. In the Notebook, we will just retrieve them by their names. For this purpose, we need to press the key on the left-hand side tab. We need to define the 5 variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `API_KEY` -- this is our API Key."

    "\n",
    "So, when we finally do have our credentials in the Notebook, what are we going to do next? We need to pass it somehow through a request to the Media Cloud API, right? Intuitively, we would do it through a payload and `request` module, right? Yes, this is a good intuition, but fortunately, we don't really have to do it this way. That is because most social media have so-called wrappers. Those are modules that allow us to connect to the API and send requests. We could still do it through our web browser, but the URL would be much more complicated.\n",
