    "The third API we are going to explore is Twitter API. On the one hand it will be the easiest one to access, on the other hand it will be the hardest one because unlike Wikipedia and Reddit it requires having not only a Twitter account but also a Developer Account. Moreover, in the version we are going to use it has a very strict limits of how much data we can actually get. However, enought with downsides. The good thing is that there is a great resource provided by Twitter itself with a very comprehensive [tutorial](https://github.com/twitterdev/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research). This notebook contains a small extract from it. So if you feel you need more information or something is unclear I would recommend seeing the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Twitter?\n",
    "\n",
    "I would assume that most of you know what Twitter is, what Tweets look like, and what kind of interactions are possible there. Just in case below a very brief definition form the above-mentioned course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Twitter is a platform that is used by people across the world to exchange thoughts, ideas and information with one another, using Tweets. Each Tweet consists of up to 280 characters and may include media such as links, images and videos. In the context of research, Twitter data refers to the public information that is provided via Twitter’s application programming interface (API). The API supports various endpoints such as recent search, filtered steam etc. that let developers and researchers connect to the API and request Twitter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if you ever saw a tweet. You probably saw it in the format like in the picture below. However, under the hood there is much more infomation (metadata) that characterize every single tweet. With luck we can get some of this information using Twitter API, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Tweet text\n",
    " * Tweet ID (that uniquely identifies a Tweet)\n",
    " * The time at which the Tweet was created\n",
    " * Public metrics associated with the Tweet such as number of retweets, number of likes etc.\n",
    " * Public user information such as username, user ID, user bio, profile image url etc.\n",
    " * Tweet Annotations - some Tweets are annotated based on the topic that they are about and the named entities present in the Tweets, i.e. COVID-19 stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete information of the data we can get from each tweet might be found in the documantation under the following [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developer Account\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned in the begining, to access Twitter API we need to establish a [Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en) (it requires having a regular account first). It requires to answer a few fairly easy questions and confirming your email. By defualt you will create a Developer Account with Essential Access to Twitter API. For the purpose of this class it will be enough but if you plan on doing a real research it is worht applying for Academic Research Access. \n",
    "\n",
    "After creating an account you should be able to log into [Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en) and create a project. In general, projects serve for organizing your access to Twitter API. Each project might contain multiple Apps (in our case it will be only one app) that serve for generating credentials for authentication. In other words, you need to create a project and later an app so Twitter can recognize that it is you who try to access the API. Therefore, you are never anonymous when you are getting the data from Twitter. More or less, they know what you are doing. [Let that sink in](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2022/10/28/late-night-elon-musk-sink-pun-twitter-orig-cprog-fj.cnn-business).\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating the App and project you simply need to answer a few simple questions. The answer should be straightforward. Untill you get to the screen looking like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"png/keys.png\" /></center>\n",
    "\n",
    " It is the most important moment because those are the credentials (authorization details you need to store somewhere safe). In this particular case, although it is not the best idea ever just just copy and paste them in the following chunk under relevant names. You should, however, try not to share them with anyone. That is because as I mentioned before they serve to identify you (it is more or less you ID for Twitter). So if someone maluses them it will be on your account. You should never share them on public repositories. Probably the best practice is to add them as envioronment variables but it is far beyond this class. Therefore, for now you will store them in this notebook (you can always access them on the Twitter Developer Paltform).\n",

    "* Stream Tweets in real-time as they are happening by specifying rules to filter for Tweets that you are interested in.\n",

    "### Academic Research Product Track\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible and rather straightforward to get access to the whole archive of tweets, dating back to 2006 (using the full-archive search endpoint). It requires just to apply for it and the benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ability to get historical Tweets from the entire archive of public conversation on Twitter, dating back to 2006 (using the full-archive search endpoint)\n",
    "* Higher monthly Tweet volume cap of 10 million Tweets per month\n",
    "* More advanced filter options to return relevant data, including a longer query length, support for more concurrent rules (for filtered stream endpoint), and additional operators that are only supported in this product track (more on this later)\n",
    "\n",
    "As Twitter states it: \"The Academic Research product track is reserved for those conducting professional academic research who have a specific research purpose with Twitter data.\" In order to get access to the academic research product track, these are the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are a graduate student, doctoral candidate, post-doc, faculty, or research-focused employee at an academic institution or university.\n",
    "* You have a clearly defined research objective, and you have specific plans for how you intend to use, analyze, and share Twitter data from your research.\n",
    "* You will use this product track for non-commercial purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "From what I know it is not very hard to get such an access to Twitter API, however, it requires writing quite a few sentences about the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The Twitter API provides different endpoints to get Tweets, based on your use-case. It is important to know which endpoint you should use, in order to get the right data. For example, if you want to get historical Tweets, you have the choice of using the [recent search endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction) (if the Tweets are from the last 7 days) or the [full-archive search endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/quick-start/full-archive-search) (if the Tweets are older than that). You can not get this historical data using a streaming endpoint such as [filtered stream endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/introduction), because that endpoint only provides Tweets in real-time, as they happen. Similarly, if you want to build your Tweet dataset from a list of Tweet IDs, you can use the [Tweet lookup endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/lookup/introduction). A good summary of the most popular endpoints with the questions they might help to answer might be found [here](https://github.com/twitterdev/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research/blob/main/modules/3-deciding-which-endpoints-to-use.md)."
