The EU\u2019s executive arm on Wednesday unveiled a series of proposals laying out the bloc\u2019s approach to data, artificial intelligence and platform regulation over the next five years and beyond. The flurry of policy initiatives aims to wean Europe off its dependence on foreign-owned tech companies while bolstering the bloc\u2019s own tech sector, with the aim of becoming more competitive against rivals in China and the United States. Presenting the package , which is made up of three documents, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen underscored that technology should comply with people\u2019s rights. \u201cWe want the digital transformation to power our economy and we want to find European solutions for the digital age,\u201d she said. The digital plan is a key priority for the current Commission, which came into office late last year in the midst of intensifying tensions over trade and tech security with both Washington and Beijing. Before starting her term, von der Leyen cited climate and tech policy as being central to her mandate and pledged to come up with legislation on artificial intelligence within her first 100 days in office. The former German defense minister has had to backtrack on that promise, as none of the documents presented are legally binding. Instead her presentation offered an over-arching roadmap for how the EU intends to develop a single market for digital services, foster access to data and move toward hard rules for AI technology. In a briefing to reporters ahead of the unveiling, Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s digital czar, described the digital package as Europe\u2019s second chance at becoming a world leader on tech. She says it can do so by leveraging industrial data for business-to-business applications. The Commission is deploying its most high-profile officials to present the strategy, which is the first major policy orientation of this term. As well as Vestager, Vice President for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton and Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders all worked on the strategies and will oversee different aspects of their implementation. In the coming three months, the Commission will collect feedback from industry, civil society and national governments on its proposals before deciding how to move forward on issues like the use of facial recognition technology. \u201cEveryone will be able to discuss [the package], including non-European companies,\u201d Thierry Breton told reporters ahead of the presentation. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Europe\u2019s big digital push: Why are there three documents instead of one? The answer is a combination of policy and politics, with top EU officials all keen to oversee different aspects of the plan. The White Paper on artificial intelligence originates with von der Leyen\u2019s promise to introduce legislation within her first 100 days in office. Officials quickly agreed that it would be premature to pass hard laws within that timeframe and instead settled on the idea of releasing a White Paper setting out the path forward. Thierry Breton, a Frenchman and former CEO of tech company Atos, is behind the second document, which focuses on how the bloc will better exploit data to support innovation and entrepreneurship while also bolstering protections. Breton convinced von der Leyen that he should be tasked with developing a standalone data strategy at the outset of his Commission term. \u201cWe cannot talk about artificial intelligence without talking about data,\" he told reporters Wednesday. Finally, in order to link the two papers together into a broader narrative that would expand on other issues including competition rules and the Green Deal, the Commission ordered up a third document entitled \u201cShaping Europe\u2019s digital future\u201d that aims to act as a 5-year policy roadmap. Will the EU draft hard law on artificial intelligence? Yes. Expect follow-up to the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, including on safety, liability, fundamental rights and data in the last quarter of the year. Much of the fine print for legislation will depend on feedback the Commission is set to receive in the coming months from industry, civil society and national governments. The EU\u2019s executive arm could decide for example to update the product liability directive, which creates a legal responsibility regime for defective products. \u201cIf you have an accident with a self-driving car, who\u2019s responsible? We\u2019ll have to define rules on such issues,\u201d Reynders told reporters ahead of the White Paper\u2019s release. At the same time, the Commission argued in its White Paper that high-risk AI technology should undergo rigorous testing before it can be deployed or sold within the EU's vast internal market, pitching the introduction of so-called \u201cconformity assessments\u201d for AI systems that pose significant risks in areas including recruitment, health care, transport and law enforcement. \u201cSo-called high-risk AI \u2014 this is AI that potentially interferes with people\u2019s rights \u2014 have to be tested and certified before they reach our single market,\u201d von der Leyen said Wednesday. Will there be a ban on facial recognition? No, although a ban was never really the Commission\u2019s plan. The short-lived proposal to impose a moratorium on facial recognition made headlines when it was mentioned in an early draft of the White Paper. But such a moratorium, which had been listed as one out of several potential policy measures, had never seriously been considered by European decision-makers, not least because Brussels has limited means to tell national governments what to do in law enforcement, according to officials involved in drafting the document. \u201cThere are already very strict rules [on facial recognition]: There is the GDPR, which allows some exceptions,\u201d Reynders told reporters ahead of the White Paper\u2019s publication. The Commission's White Paper will kick off a debate on which exceptions are acceptable. The final document now calls for \u201cspecific requirements\u201d for \u201cremote biometric identification systems\u201d \u2014 a broader term describing technology that analyzes information about your body such as your face or voice, and compares that with stored data to identify individuals. Such biometric systems should adhere to strict transparency requirements as well as tough criteria when it comes to the algorithms underlying them and the data they use to be trained. How is the EU planning to build a single market for data? By convincing industrial players to share their data with startups, the public sector or other enterprises that want to use it to develop new applications. The ambition is to make Europe the go-to place for high-quality industrial data that can be used, for instance, to create AI tools. The first concrete policy deliverable in the data strategy is a framework for \u201ccommon European data spaces\" to be published by the end of 2020. These \u201cspaces\u201d would be designed to encourage companies to pool data, according to a senior EU official. If all goes according to plan, the project could be implemented as early as 2022. In 2021, the Commission will roll out its new \u201cData Act,\u201d which will remove barriers and introduce rules for business-to-business and business-to-government (B2G) data sharing, and potentially give people an \"enhanced portability right,\" or the ability to bring their data from one company to another. While business-to-government data sharing has so far received little attention in the broader digital strategy, it represents a core part of the Commission\u2019s philosophy. Such rules would allow the public sector to tap into the wealth of data from private companies to benefit society. The Commission plans to create a legal foundation for a data market that already exists \u2014 for example when private companies share their data to improve disaster relief or traffic congestion in major cities. \u201cThe European Union will be the first jurisdiction in the world to provide a framework that will try to stimulate and incentivize privately held data to be shared and reused for the public interest,\u201d said Alberto Alemanno, the B2G data sharing expert group \u2019s rapporteur. An idea that was adopted from the expert group into the the Commission\u2019s final data strategy is the creation of \u201cdata stewards,\u201d meaning people who would be in charge of facilitating and coordinating data sharing. What sectors will be affected? While the digital strategy is nominally tech-focused, it will have a major impact on agriculture, energy, health, financial services and transport. The Commission\u2019s vision for \u201cdata spaces\u201d refers to large pools of data that can be shared per sector. How data gets shared will vary by sector. In the health sector, for example, public health authorities could be compelled to share patient data in European \u201chealth data spaces.\u201d The pooled data would be made accessible to researchers who could use it to develop new treatments for diseases, while also helping to check the impact of treatments on patients across the Continent. With electronic health monitors like smart watches becoming more commonplace, insurers will also be paying close attention. Data culled from such applications could also be pooled and used for large-scale studies or health programs. In the financial sector, asset managers and bankers will be scouring the Commission\u2019s plans for any move to force financial firms to create digital portals that provide client data to fintech companies. When it comes to AI, the Commission believes that particularly strict rules should apply to \u201chigh-risk\u201d sectors such as health care, transport or public administrations \u2014 for instance when doctors use an AI system to help them diagnose cancer and make potential life-or-death decisions. Will the Commission further regulate platforms such as Google and Facebook? Firm proposals on platform regulation will only be known toward the end of the year, when the Commission unveils its so-called Digital Services Act package. But the digital strategy, which binds the proposals together, does refer to so-called \u201cgatekeeper\u201d platforms as needing to remain \u201cfair\u201d \u2014 a category that could include Google and Amazon. Some rules may apply to the big platforms \"without consideration of illegal behavior, but just because they\u2019re a dominant player in the digital world,\" Vestager told reporters. \u201cThe Commission will further explore \u2026 ex ante rules to ensure that markets characterised by large platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers, remain fair and contestable for innovators, businesses, and new market entrants,\u201d reads the digital strategy. Under the previous Commission, Brussels launched a formal probe into U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon over its \"dual role\" as a marketplace and seller of products. Later this year, the Commission will launch a sector inquiry focusing on \u201cnew and emerging markets that are shaping our economy and society.\u201d Also to be expected is legislation setting rules on how platforms such as Google, Facebook and Twitter police content online. Whether platforms will be held legally responsible for the illegal material they host remains an open question, Vestager and Breton said. A public consultation will be launched in March. Earlier this week, proposals on content moderation made by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg got a cold reception from the Commission. On disinformation, the Commission plans a European Democracy Action Plan to ensure election integrity. How will the digital strategy work with the Green Deal? The Commission wants the bloc to become carbon neutral by 2050 under the Green Deal, which means the tech sector will be forced to reduce its carbon footprint. According to the Commission, the ICT sector accounts for more than 2 percent of global greenhouse emissions. To reconcile Europe\u2019s climate objectives with its tech ambitions, Brussels will push for data centers to become carbon neutral by 2030. \u201cWe need to press certain sectors where they can be better \u2014 one of those is data centers, which are major power consumers,\u201d a senior Commission official said. In Ireland, home to U.S. tech giants such as Google and Facebook, electricity demand is expected to increase by 50 percent by 2030 \u2014 30 percent of that rise is due to the country\u2019s data centers. Data centers have an impact on how the electricity market works and could boost renewable energies if they decide to use clean electricity, the Commission official said. Another \u201cpositive contribution\u201d could be the reuse of the heat generated by the servers, he added. In 2021, the Commission is also planning to float a \u201ccircular electronics initiative\u201d to make devices such as smartphones last longer while being easier to repair and recycle. What about the \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac? One of the main challenges is where to find the money to bridge the investment gap that the Commission estimates at \u20ac65 billion per year. \u201cEvery time we promise something, there is a caveat, as it\u2019s subject to the final decision of the Multi-Annual Financial Framework,\u201d said a senior Commission official, referring to the long-term budget of the EU currently under discussion by national governments. The Commission wants to invest up to \u20ac6 billion to create the infrastructure for a single market for data. About \u20ac2 billion would come from the Commission itself, while the rest would be raised from member countries and industry. The Commission\u2019s proposal for the total EU budget for the next seven years is about \u20ac1.135 trillion . Only around 3 percent of that is devoted to tech, according to tech lobby DigitalEurope , which urges capitals to raise the share devoted to the digital transformation to 10 percent. However, the final budget relies on unanimous agreement from all 27 EU countries. The European Council President Charles Michel has suggested a total budget of \u20ac1.095 trillion to member countries. A special summit of heads of states and governments will take place later this week to talk about how much money is spent. \u201c[Digital] is a priority for us,\u201d said the senior Commission official. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s also a priority for the member states.\u201d Bjarke Smith-Meyer, Simon Van Dorpe and Carmen Paun contributed to this report.

Civil rights advocates have warned that such \u201clive\u201d or \u201cautomated\u201d facial recognition systems pave the way for mass surveillance on an unprecedented scale, but in a landmark case earlier this year , a U.K. court ruled that South Wales Police had used similar technology lawfully. Earlier today, German news wire DPA reported that the German interior ministry dropped plans to roll out similar technology at over a hundred train stations across the country,  following warning s by legal experts that the use would likely infringe the country\u2019s constitution. Britain's data privacy regulator said in a statement that it had been informed of the move by Met Police. \"We have received assurances from the MPS [Met Police] that it is considering the impact of this technology and is taking steps to reduce intrusion and comply with the requirements of data protection legislation,\" the Information Commissioner's Office said.", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "London police to roll out live facial recognition"}
{"_id": "587266261407195_1839484876185321", "content": "Face-scanning technology is inspiring a wave of privacy fears as the software creeps into every corner of life in the United States and Europe \u2014 at border crossings, on police vehicles and in stadiums, airports and high schools. But efforts to check its spread are hitting a wall of resistance on both sides of the Atlantic. One big reason: Western governments are embracing this technology for their own use, valuing security and data collection over privacy and civil liberties. And in Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment and the death of a key civil rights and privacy champion have snarled expectations for a congressional drive to enact restrictions. The result is an impasse that has left tech companies largely in control of where and how to deploy facial recognition, which they have sold to police agencies and embedded in consumers\u2019 apps and smartphones. The stalemate has persisted even in Europe\u2019s most privacy-minded countries, such as Germany, and despite a bipartisan U.S. alliance of civil-libertarian Democrats and Republicans. Advocates for tighter regulations point to China as an example of the technology\u2019s nightmare potential, amid reports authorities are using it to indiscriminately track citizens in public, identify pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and oppress millions of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang. Current implementations of the software also perpetuate racial bias by misidentifying people of color far more frequently than white people, according to a U.S. government study released just before Congress left town for Christmas. \u201cFacial recognition needs to be stopped before a fait accompli is established,\u201d Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament for the Pirate Party Germany, told POLITICO. \"The use of facial recognition technology poses a staggering threat to Americans\u2019 privacy,\" Democratic Senator Ed Markey, who is prepping legislation to crack down on the software, said in June . But police and security forces across the West are still rapidly testing or rolling out the technology, adopting it as an inexpensive way to keep tabs on large groups of people. Cameras and artificial intelligence that can identify people based on their facial features are also showing up at border crossings, on police vehicles, at the entrances to stadiums and even in some high schools in the U.S. and Europe, where they are used to identify students. Such examples far outnumber the facial recognition bans enacted in San Francisco and some other U.S. cities. In Washington, a once-promising bipartisan push in the House of Representatives to limit the federal government's use of facial recognition has stalled for unrelated reasons, including the death of former House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings and acrimony over impeachment. And in the Senate, more limited proposals to rein in federal agencies' use of the technology have been slow to pick up support. But privacy activists are drawing a broader lesson from governments\u2019 failure to check the technology\u2019s spread, saying it is eroding the differences between the way Western governments and China approach public surveillance. \u201cThere is growing evidence that the U.S. is increasingly using AI in oppressive and harmful ways that echo China\u2019s use,\u201d AI Now, a research group at New York University, wrote in a report published this month that underscored the spread of \"invasive\" artificial intelligence technology. 'Fundamental rights' In both the U.S. and Europe, the stuttering progress of efforts to regulate facial recognition stems from a blend of reluctance by security-obsessed governments and setbacks that have stymied lawmakers\u2019 focus. The latter obstacles have included the death in October of Cummings, whose panel had seemed poised to craft bipartisan legislation restricting face-scanning by federal agencies. Several top Democrats and Republicans on the committee have also been embroiled in the monthslong dispute over Trump's impeachment and upcoming Senate trial. Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike acknowledged in interviews with POLITICO that the effort has stalled. \"Unfortunately impeachment has sucked all the energy out of the room,\" Republican Senator Stephen Lynch, who chairs the Oversight National Security Subcommittee, said this month. \"There hasn't been anything that's happened right now. \u2026 Elijah's death put that on hold,\" said Senator Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the top Republican on the Oversight Government Operations Subcommittee. In the European Union, meanwhile, calls by top leaders for quick action on regulating artificial intelligence aren\u2019t guaranteed to result in any binding EU-wide restrictions. Even the strict limits on gathering of \u201csensitive data\" in the EU\u2019s premier privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation, contain a broad carve-out for public authorities that can collect sensitive biometric data if they can justify it. That loophole has allowed facial recognition technology to pop up in locations such as a major Berlin train station , where an experimental project by the authorities has scanned tens of thousands of passersby. Even so, Breyer said he is confident Europe will ultimately end up with stricter limits on facial recognition than the United States. The lawmaker argues that the EU\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which grants every European citizen \u201cthe right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her,\u201d will protect Europeans from indiscriminate use of facial recognition, while the U.S. Constitution says nothing to that effect, and will not. \u201cIn the U.S., if you\u2019re moving around public spaces, there essentially is no right to privacy,\u201d said Breyer, who was trained as a lawyer. \u201cHere, it\u2019s the other way around: There is a basic right to data protection and informational self-determination, which means that every piece of data that\u2019s collected and processed about us means an intrusion into our basic rights, and [law enforcement agencies] can only do that on a legal basis, and after being granted permission.\u201d Tech industry leaders are meanwhile seizing on the opportunity to shape any global rules that may emerge. In December 2018, Microsoft President Brad Smith unveiled principles for facial recognition regulations in a rare call to action from a leading industry figure. Amazon Web Services' public policy chief, Michael Punke, urged lawmakers to enact legislation that would both \"protect civil rights while also allowing for continued innovation and practical application of the technology.\" For now, though, face-scanning tools are rapidly becoming commonplace, embraced by the public and private sector alike. Say goodbye to anonymity At the same time, companies like Facebook, Apple and Google have built facial recognition into their most popular devices, for instance as a means of unlocking phones or automatically tagging friends in photos. Amazon has emerged as a top supplier of easy-to-use facial recognition systems, whose customers have included police departments and U.S. government agencies. Among public authorities, the appetite for facial recognition systems seems to know no bounds. Across the United States, federal, state and local agencies have been conducting so-called experiments for years, with the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection both use facial recognition at select points of entry. On the state and local levels, police departments in Florida, Colorado and Oregon have begun to adopt the technology, with others exploring its use. The situation is no different in Europe. In the U.K., two police forces have been testing facial recognition technology to identify passersby in real time with street cameras. The French government has rolled out a facial-recognition-enabled ID card over protests from digital rights groups. Meanwhile, Hungary\u2019s interior ministry is installing 35,000 cameras across its capital, Budapest, and the rest of the country to capture both facial images and license plates. Facial recognition is already up and running at some European airports from Lisbon to Prague, where passengers from the EU and Switzerland can skip long lines by opting for an automated border control system scanning their faces. \"That\u2019s worrying,\" said Matthias Monroy, a civil liberties activist who works for the leftist Die Linke party in the German parliament. Paired with the power of artificial intelligence and high-powered computing, such technology may soon \u201cmake it impossible to move around anonymously in a public space,\" he added. \u2018Virtually unrestricted\u2019 In the U.S., the debate around facial recognition has focused mainly on government's use of the technology. After the American Civil Liberties Union issued a report on Amazon's sale of its Rekognition software to police departments, San Francisco became the first city in the world to ban local agencies from using the technology, in a blueprint that activists hope will be replicated elsewhere. That cause has also found a following in Washington, where a coalition of congressional Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans, worried about the implications of unchecked government surveillance, wants to restrict the use of facial recognition by federal agencies like the FBI, TSA and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Leaders of the House Oversight Committee have explored a bill that would block funding for any new use or expanded use of the technology by the federal government, the panel\u2019s top Republican told POLITICO in August. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more money being used, no money used to expand what we have or to purchase any new ability to impact or use this technology,\u201d Republican Senator Jim Jordan told POLITICO at the time. A \u201cvast majority\u201d of House Oversight Republicans still favor a federal timeout, Jordan said more recently, though he conceded that \u201cI\u2019ve been all focused all on impeachment.\u201d Before his death, then-committee chairman Cummings warned at a hearing last spring that under current law, the government can use the technology to \u201cmonitor you without your knowledge and enter your face into a database that could be used in virtually unrestricted ways.\u201d He later called the issue \u201cone of the few things that everybody, Democrats and Republicans, seem to agree on.\u201d The committee\u2019s new chairwoman, Republican Senator Carolyn Maloney, has expressed a desire to revisit the issue but has not committed to pushing for a moratorium on federal use. And even if such a proposal were to advance in the Democratic-controlled House, it would likely face opposition in the GOP-controlled Senate from moderate Republicans, many of whom see the emerging technology as a crucial law enforcement tool. \"I think that is unlikely to gain support in the Senate,\" Senator Chris Coons told POLITICO this month when asked about the prospects of a moratorium. Coons in November partnered with Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a libertarian-leaning Republican, to introduce legislation requiring that federal agencies obtain a warrant before using facial recognition for targeted surveillance. But even more narrow proposals such as that bill, which has yet to pick up any additional co-sponsors, have failed to gain traction in the chamber to this point. In Brussels, new European Commission leader Ursula von der Leyen has promised to take on facial recognition as part of a pledge to write binding rules for artificial intelligence during the first 100 days of her term in office, which started on December 1. That call coincides with a series of rulings from data protection authorities in various EU states, which have called for caution in deploying mainly \"live\" facial recognition and urged public authorities to draft legislation around its use. In the past few weeks, privacy watchdogs in Sweden, France and the United Kingdom have all issued position papers on the subject, with the French and Swedish regulators halting efforts to deploy facial recognition at the entrances to high schools. However, the Commission\u2019s road map for AI does does not necessarily mean any EU-wide rules on facial recognition will ever see the light of day. Despite promises to encode accepted practices in law, European officials have voiced a cacophony of opinions on what exactly the law on AI should contain, with high-ranking bureaucrats hinting that it may skew toward guiding principles instead of hard rules. That is why it's likely that courts and data protection watchdogs will write those rules in Europe. In late August, a British court rejected the first major attempt to curtail police use of facial recognition, saying security benefits outweighed the risk to privacy and individual freedoms. Legal experts expect European rules for facial recognition in law enforcement to come in the form of what\u2019s known as \u201cex post\u201d regulation: First, law enforcement will take advantage of existing legal gray zones and start deploying the technology \u2014 until either a judge or a data protection authority will restrict or stop that use, or rule that it conforms with existing law. Cases that could set such precedent are underway. Steven Overly in Arlington, Virginia, Isabella Borshoff in Cardiff, U.K., and Lauren Bishop in Brussels contributed to this report.

General Assembly in New York late Tuesday, calling on them to be \"more ambitious\" in ensuring \"that new advances reflect our values.\" \"In the future, voice connectivity will be in every room and almost every object,\" the PM said. \"Your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese, your front door will sweep wide the moment you approach, like some silent butler; your smart meter will go hustling for the cheapest electricity. And every one of them minutely transcribing your every habit in tiny electronic shorthand, stored not in their chips or their innards ... but in some great cloud of data that lours ever more oppressively over the human race, a giant dark thundercloud waiting to burst. And we have no control over how or when the precipitation will take place.\" The \"internet of things\" could be useful, but \"could also be used to keep every citizen under round-the-clock surveillance,\" Johnson told the half-empty audience, as some leaders and their envoys appeared to be attempting to stifle their mirth . \"A future [Amazon] Alexa will pretend to take orders. But this Alexa will be watching you, clucking her tongue and stamping her foot.\" Johnson also pondered the implications of artificial intelligence. \u201cAI, what will it mean?\u201d he mused. \u201cHelpful robots washing and caring for an aging population, or pink-eyed terminators sent back from the future to cull the human race? What will synthetic biology stand for: restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure? Or will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables? Will nanotechnology help us to beat disease, or will it leave tiny robots to replicate in the crevices of our cells?\" In his one nod to Brexit, Johnson likened the process of quitting the EU to Greek mythology. \"When Prometheus brought fire to mankind ... Zeus punished him by chaining him to a Tartarean crag while his liver was pecked out by an eagle,\" the PM noted. \"And every time his liver regrew the eagle came back and pecked it again. And this went on forever \u2014 a bit like the experience of Brexit in the U.K., if some of our parliamentarians had their way.\" Johnson also used his address to the U.N. to lament the fact there are \"people today who are actually still anti-science,\" pointing to those who oppose vaccination, \"and who by their prejudices are actually endangering the very children they want to protect.\" He added: \"I totally reject this anti-scientific pessimism.\" Johnson concluded his speech by inviting the assembled leaders to a tech summit next year in London, where, he joked \"it is not raining 94 percent of the time.\"", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "Boris Johnson warns of \u2018digital authoritarianism\u2019 in UN speech"}
{"_id": "587266261407195_1656171147850029", "content": "Europe's privacy watchdogs are looking to tighten restrictions on the use of facial recognition in a shift that could limit how governments and large companies use the technology. Police and security forces across the EU increasingly resort to facial recognition to scan crowds for threats, with use cases popping up in Berlin , Copenhagen and on the streets of U.K. cities . Tech companies are also big users, as Facebook automatically scans profiles to match photographs against users who have provided consent and Apple uses face-scanning to unlock phones. But as the technology becomes more widespread, it's also growing more controversial. Amid reports of unbridled public surveillance in China, data protection activists around Europe argue that scanning faces without explicit consent amounts to a violation of the bloc's sweeping privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation. Now a group of European privacy watchdogs is set to lend them support. According to representatives from two national authorities who spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity, watchdogs discussed new guidelines on Tuesday at a joint meeting in Brussels that would effectively tighten restrictions around the use of facial recognition technology. In particular, the watchdogs are looking to reclassify facial recognition data as \"biometric data,\" which under the GDPR is considered \"sensitive data\" and requires explicit consent from the person whose data is being collected as well as other stricter privacy protections. Without these, collection of the data is forbidden. The draft change, which coincides with a warning about police use of face-scanning by U.K. privacy watchdog Elizabeth Denham, has a potentially far-reaching impact for governments and private corporations, namely Silicon Valley companies that are subject to the GDPR when they collect data on Europeans. If national data protection authorities endorse the draft guidelines and start to police facial recognition more closely, use of the technology could be severely curtailed. Current methods to alert the public that they are under video surveillance, typically the display of a prominent sign, would not rise to the standard of \"explicit consent\" required for collecting biometric data. Facebook tagging in crosshairs The guidelines come as debate about police use of facial recognition reaches a fever pitch in the United Kingdom. On Tuesday, Information Commissioner Denham stated in a blogpost she is \"deeply concerned\" about police use of facial recognition, and that \"there were still significant privacy and data protection issues that must be addressed\" amid an ongoing investigation of police trials by her office. \"I believe that there needs to be demonstrable evidence that the technology is necessary, proportionate and effective considering the invasiveness of LFR,\" meaning live facial recognition, she added. Any change in the way EU data protection watchdogs police biometric data is also likely to have an immediate impact on big tech firms, namely Facebook. Early last year, following a ban on mass-scanning of profile pages in the EU, the social network reintroduced automatic scanning of profile pictures while asking users for consent to be tagged thanks to facial recognition technology. At the time, privacy activists argued that the consent was not valid because even users who opted out would have their biometric data scanned. The Irish Data Protection agency \u2014 Facebook's lead regulator within the EU \u2014 sought guidance from other European agencies. A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment. \"We'll get the right level of consent to use facial recognition going forward,\" Stephen Deadman, Facebook's global deputy chief privacy officer, said in an interview last year in reference to the technology's rollout in Europe. The guidelines are expected to go through a public consultation process before being finalized by the watchdogs. A spokesperson for the European Data Protection Board, the pan-EU group of privacy regulators, declined to comment.

{"_id": "587266261407195_1610371475763330", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 Deep in the heart of Germany, a team of scientists is trying to crack one of the fundamental problems of artificial intelligence: teaching a machine to understand cause and effect. Their work could revolutionize how computers \"learn,\" making them more independent from human oversight and strengthening the hand of any country or company in possession of such next-generation AI tech. But the scientists, many of whom were trained in European universities, are not working for any European firm or research body. They are employees of Amazon, the Seattle-based e-commerce behemoth that is locked in a global race for AI dominance against other U.S. tech giants, as well as new rivals from China, including Jack Ma's Alibaba e-retail site. Key to Amazon's strategy is technological superiority, and specifically the holy grail of deploying AI to improve user experience and optimize warehousing and delivery of products to its customers around the world. To stay ahead, Amazon is betting heavily on Germany. In addition to three research sites in various cities, the company in 2017 opened an additional lab in the university town of T\u00fcbingen in cooperation with the Max Planck Society, now employing hundreds of AI researchers across the country. If things go to plan, the T\u00fcbingen group will soon be moving into a sleek (but yet to be built) four-storey building, cementing Amazon's presence in what some call Germany's \"Cyber Valley.\" \u201cArtificial intelligence was already supported here at a time when that wasn\u2019t popular,\u201d said Amazon\u2019s Director of Machine Learning Ralf Herbrich, who oversees all of the company\u2019s AI operations together with Amazon\u2019s chief economist in Seattle. But amid the fervor to unlock AI's mysteries, some Germans are casting a wary eye on Amazon's push into the country. While they welcome the firm's investments \u2014 Amazon employs some 18,000 people in Germany, from warehouse workers to scientists \u2014 they caution that the fruits of Amazon's research will go to enrich the company, and ultimately the U.S. economy, not Germany. The country's own high-tech sector, one of the key pillars of its economic wealth, could end up as a collateral victim, they fear. Some \u201cof the best AI researchers worldwide come from Germany,\u201d Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said during a government conference in December. \u201cBut many of them have contracts with Google, with Amazon, with Apple, with Microsoft. And the research done here is used ... to bring their products to the market.\" Amazon's German AI mastermind None of that is holding Amazon back. The heart of its operation is in central Berlin, in a converted garment factory near where a wall once bisected the city. Ralf Herbrich, a towering computer scientist, is in charge of managing the company's network of research centers in Germany while ensuring that AI is considered part of any new service developed by Amazon around the world. He's not a man who likes to waste time. Herbrich does not schedule more than five meetings per day, instead preferring to ingest three to four \"longer documents\" in addition to some 200 emails, because he says that his brain can process text more than twice as fast as spoken words. Active in the field for decades, Herbrich chalks up Germany's popularity with U.S. tech firms to the fact that many researchers here focused on machine learning at a time when the field was considered niche, if not irrelevant blue-sky science. When Herbrich completed his doctorate at Berlin\u2019s Technical University in the late 1990s, most people who wanted to find a job quickly focused on computer graphics or databases. But \u201cto have the stamina and say 'No, this field is important and it will be relevant, even if that takes two decades' \u2014 that has helped us a lot,\u201c said the 45-year-old. \u201cThis puts [Germany] in a very, very good position when it comes to the strength of its basic research.\" After stints with Microsoft and Facebook, he joined Amazon in Seattle in 2012 as director of machine learning, before returning to Berlin in 2013 to oversee an expansion of AI research in his home country. Since then, the combination of increased computing power, the growth of giant data pools and the emergence of cloud computing has turbo-boosted the development of AI into a technology that today can power day-to-day applications , and Amazon's Chief Executive Jeff Bezos took notice of AI's potential to boost his company's appeal to customers. Herbrich gradually expanded Amazon's AI footprint across Germany. Currently, one team in the western city of Aachen is working on improving voice recognition for Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, while another in Dresden, eastern Germany, is trying to boost the company's cloud service thanks to AI. In T\u00fcbingen, scientists are trying to improve how computers measure the human body, in addition to studying cause and effect. Berlin remains the biggest hub. The company now has more than 800 employees in the German capital, 100 of which are directly involved in developing AI. The Berlin office gathers scientists who are trying to improve Amazon's marketplace \u2014 for example, by automatically translating product descriptions or using AI to predict the demand of products \u2014 as well as those who teach robots how to find and grab objects. Amazon's ability to pay top euro ensures it can attract the best talent in the bloc. But it's also stirring concerns about an \"internal brain drain\" \u2014 where local talent stays at home but works for foreign companies \u2014 as well as an erosion of research capital in Germany. \u201cAt some point, there will be no more good computer scientists left at universities to train the next generation of developers for Amazon,\u201d cautioned one computer science professor, who asked not to be named. Industry is also worried. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for Germany\u2019s engineering firms or car companies,\u201d said Stefan Heumann, the co-director of think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, who advises the German parliament on AI. \u201cAll of a sudden, they \u2014 quite literally \u2014 have those tech companies in front of their door, and have to compete with them for talent.\u201d Beyond deep learning Amazon's hunt for tech talent goes beyond Germany. The firm has opened development centers across Europe, employing more than 5,500 developers and researchers in eleven countries. But Germany is in a league of its own in terms of investment. The T\u00fcbingen lab is within walking distance from a branch of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPIIS), one of the country's leading AI research institutes. Every Monday, MPIIS researchers come over to be briefed by Amazon\u2019s scientists about what they are working on. \u201cResearch means lots of discussions,\u201d Herbrich said. \u201cResearch means sorting out what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d As part of the quid pro quo, Amazon researchers help Germany tackle one of the problems holding the country back on the technological front: Its failure to turn basic research into real-life applications. \u201cOur experience at Amazon is that this process which is often called \u2018technology transfer\u2019 works easiest if it involves the same people,\u201d Herbrich said. Under Herbrich, Amazon is taking on some thorny problems. Many of these have to do with making predictions based on patterns discovered in vast troves of data. But such \"deep learning\" is only effective up to a point, after which new techniques are required \u2014 for instance to understand cause and effect. Cracking causality, by adding layers of AI on top of current deep learning techniques, is one of the field's next frontiers, and a key area of work at T\u00fcbingen. As always with Amazon, this research is eventually geared toward optimizing customer experiences. Amazon has tools to predict which customers will click on what product, but it is still trying to understand why customers choose as they do, to see if the choice has to do with display or just the fact that a holiday is looming, for example. As part of their current experiments, researchers are currently testing different ways of displaying products to various focus groups, in line with how a medical research group tests medication. But that method takes time and manpower, both of which could be reduced if AI understood causality. This research is one example of how Amazon is amassing a deep store of technical know-how that can be leveraged into superiority on the world stage. European policymakers are keeping watch, wary that technological leaps could help Amazon to increase its powerful position in many markets including cloud computing, where it already holds a market share of around 32 percent . At a tech conference in January, Economy Minister Altmaier said Amazon\u2019s smart speaker Alexa is \u201cthe greatest basic innovation since the invention of the steam engine,\" adding that there needsd to be a European equivalent. But Alexa has European roots: Parts of it were programmed by teams in Poland and the U.K. \u2014 and some of the algorithms that help it translate answers were written in Germany.

But the smart city vision comes with an Achilles' heel \u2014 cyber vulnerability. Growing decarbonization efforts coupled with state-of-the-art technology are creating an increasingly wired energy infrastructure that poses a huge cybersecurity challenge. The risks range from hackers trying to crash the systems to snoops gathering data on people to extortionists and social media abusers like Cambridge Analytica \u2014 the defunct political consultancy that used data to shift elections. \"Some of those functions and equipment that are creating this new way of life have the potential for being vulnerable so we need to get it right,\" said Thomas Lund-S\u00f8rensen, director of the Danish Center for Cyber Security, which is part of the country's national intelligence agency. \"If you get it wrong, you get the smart city to potentially become a dumb or dangerous city.\" The EnergyLab smart city project covers about 1,400 households in Copenhagen's Nordhavn district, an up-and-coming neighborhood boasting futuristic architecture that used to be an industrial port area. Copenhagen is under pressure to slash its greenhouse gas emissions as it has committed to becoming the world's first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. The project, which brings together utilities, operators, the municipality, a university and key technology providers, is testing how automated technology can integrate electricity and heating with energy efficient buildings and electric transport to create a more sustainable energy system. Residents have to agree to participate. Then smart gadgetry is installed in selected buildings of the neighbourhood. The smart city project involves sharing large amounts of data across the various infrastructures to make sure the system runs properly. In one section of the experiment, about 60 households are providing real-time detailed information about their energy consumption to test automated heating systems. In other cases, residents can access apps on their phones to turn off lights or tweak temperatures. Each apartment has a router and data is transferred through a VPN connection to a protected server room at the Technical University of Denmark, said Anders Christian Laage Kragh, software developer with the university. The readings can indicate how many people there are in a given house, room temperatures and more. That sort of granular information is needed as energy systems become smarter and more decentralized \u2014 but it's also opening the door to more risks. Who's watching? For now, the people taking part in the experiment seem confident that their data is secure. EnergyLab project managers said that out of all the residents asked to volunteer to share detailed energy consumption data, only one decided to opt out. Denmark \"is one of the countries with the highest degree of trust from citizens towards authorities,\" said Christoffer Greisen, manager for the EnergyLab project. But he and his team still spent months making sure they got the data privacy aspect correct. \"We are all scared about what has been done ... under the Cambridge Analytica scandal,\" he said. Danish law has safeguards. So, for example, the energy data can't be used to sniff out if a person is breaking the rules by having too many people living in a house. \"It's unlawful to use the same data to detect social fraud,\" said Greisen. The goal is to design smart energy solutions that minimize the amount of personal identifiable information that needs to be collected, Lund-S\u00f8rensen said. But there are more risks than keeping information private. Protecting the system against cyberattacks \"is integral\" to the EnergyLab project, Greisen said, adding that someone \"would need the most sophisticated code breaking tools\" to hack the system. Engineers are working with \"more or less state of the art\" cyber solutions for the project, but Laage Kragh added they didn't go for anything extra. \"We have done what you normally do in this kind of project.\" Even if hackers managed to break through, the consequences of a small-scale project like EnergyLab is \"benign,\" Greisen said. The worst a hacker could do is switch off the heating in about four dozen apartments, but there would be no loss of life or massive blackouts. Not everything tested in the \u20ac19 million Nordhavn project will be implemented on a large scale, said Greisen. \"It\u2019s a bouquet of solutions, some of them will live and some of them will die.\" But if the scale changes, so do the risks. \"It's a different story if you have a million households and you can switch off the heating or electricity and then you can switch it on again \u2014 then you can actually crash the system,\" Greisen said. \"As you scale this in size, you also need to scale the cybersecurity approach.\" That's something Lund-S\u00f8rensen, of the Danish Center for Cyber Security, is very aware of. In its annual report last year, the center found that the threats of cyber espionage and cybercrime against the Danish energy sector are both \"very high.\" \"Cyber crime aimed at disrupting IT networks and IT infrastructure could, at worst, threaten energy supply,\" according to the report. Not all attacks would necessarily aim for a blackout. There are also worries about stealing or deleting data, or disconnecting smaller smart devices in homes or public buildings. If a system is unsecured, it doesn't take a hacking genius to exploit that vulnerability, Lund-S\u00f8rensen said, warning that \"that's why you need to make sure when you construct smart infrastructure in a smart city that they are not vulnerable.\" European problems That's not exactly what's happening across Europe, said Anjos Nijk, managing director at the European Network for Cyber Security, a non-profit group. Copenhagen is just one of many European cities trying to go \"smart\": Stockholm is experimenting with smart trash bins and smart traffic control, while Vienna is adopting electric-powered waste collection vehicles and testing the use of plants to green building facades to boost climate adaptation. The EU aims to replace at least 80 percent of electricity meters with smart meters by 2020, but the project is moving more slowly than expected. However, cybersecurity \"is not always very well addressed yet,\" said Nijk. One problem is that some technologies are not tested or built with cyberthreats in mind before they are introduced into the system. Another issue, Nijk said, is that once such equipment is installed, it's not easy for authorities to get a clear understanding of the risk they pose. Take electric car-charging stations. If a region has a lot of them, they could disrupt the grid if they were hacked. \"Municipalities deploying infrastructure for electric cars are often not aware of the risks because they don't have the security knowledge,\" Nijk said. The European Commission is trying to address some of those issues through its Smart Grid Task Force, a grouping of experts set up in 2009 in part in reaction to planned massive rollout of smart meters across the EU. A special working group within the task force is expected to soon release its second report with cybersecurity recommendations for the electricity system. Back in Denmark, Lund-S\u00f8rensen has advice for smart city developers: \"Please consider that you are in an environment where someone might be trying to do bad things.\" This article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO \u2019s premium policy service.

An expert panel is set to present to the bloc\u2019s leaders a list of 33 recommendations on how to move forward on AI governance Wednesday, including a stark warning against the use of AI to control and monitor citizens. In a 48-page final draft of the document, obtained by POLITICO , the experts urge policymakers to define \u201cred lines\u201d for high-risk AI applications \u2014 such as systems to mass monitor individuals or rank them according to their behavior \u2014 and discuss outlawing some controversial technology. \u201cBan AI-enabled mass-scale scoring of individuals,\u201d the expert group demands, adding that there needs to be \u201cvery clear and strict rules for surveillance for national security purposes and other purposes claimed to be in the public or national interest.\u201d But the EU's specialists also advise against imposing one-size-fits-all rules on low-risk AI applications, many of which are still in an early stage of development. In terms of broader rules for artificial intelligence, the EU should think twice about drafting new legislation, the experts write, and first review existing regulation to make it fit for AI. \u201cUnnecessarily prescriptive regulation should be avoided,\u201d the group writes. \u201cNot all risks are equal,\u201d they add, and lawmakers should focus on regulating those areas that pose the greatest risk. The recommendations mark the EU\u2019s first shot at defining the conditions under which AI should be developed and deployed in its vast internal market. To date, they're the most detailed pitch on how Europe could catch up with the global frontrunners U.S. and China in an ongoing race for AI supremacy. Although non-binding, they\u2019re likely to influence policy decisions made by the next European Commission, which is set to take office in November and is expected to make AI a priority early on in its mandate. Surveillance apparatus Artificial intelligence technology, allowing machines to do tasks that previously required human thinking , is about to revolutionize the way people live, work or go to war, and it offers vast opportunities from better treating cancer patients to making global supply chains more energy-efficient. But it also comes with significant risks. The emerging technologies can, for example, be abused by authoritarian regimes to set up a ubiquitous surveillance apparatus. Most prominently, China has been using cutting-edge AI to build up a high-tech surveillance system and crack down on political dissent, according to media reports \u2014 and other countries around the world, including European nations such as Serbia , have struck deals with Chinese companies to introduce their own systems aimed at monitoring individuals. Even within the European Union, where citizens are protected by strict privacy laws, governments from London to Berlin have been dabbling in facial-recognition technology. \u201cWe need [regulation], I\u2019m convinced of that,\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during a tech conference in Dresden last week, adding that \u201cmuch of that should be European regulation.\u201d In what seems like a reference to Beijing\u2019s surveillance apparatus but without naming China, the EU's AI experts write in their recommendations that \u201cindividuals should not be subject to unjustified \u2026 identification, profiling and nudging through AI powered methods of biometric recognition.\u201d They pitch introducing a mandatory screening process for certain high-risk AI applications developed by the private sector and say that civil society should be involved in defining \u201cred lines\u201d for which applications should be banned. Guiding principles vs hard rules Experts warn that the risk posed by artificial intelligence goes beyond being abused by governments to spy on their citizens: Most of today\u2019s cutting-edge AI systems, for instance, work by finding correlations in huge masses of data and are prone to discriminate against minorities. This has led to AI-powered recruiting tools discriminating against women , or text analysis software labeling being Jewish or being gay as negative. Against this backdrop, a debate between policymakers, researchers and the private sector is raging on whether hard rules are necessary to regulate day-to-day AI applications, and who should be in charge of writing them. \u201cWe have up to now a kind of light-touch approach: We don\u2019t want to kill innovation by regulation,\u201d Justice Commissioner V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1 said at an event in June. \u201cAI can improve our life and many sectors \u2026 but of course, there are again the risks which should be addressed,\" she added. \"We want to have the development of AI but not at the expense of fundamental rights and freedoms, and all the other values that are so dear to us.\u201d The EU's AI experts \u2014 most of whom are from the corporate world and academia \u2014 write that AI does need monitoring, but regulation should come as broad guiding principles rather than specific rules laying out in detail what businesses and researchers can and can\u2019t do. The document follows the release of guidelines for the ethical development and use of AI in April, written by the same experts. In that previous document, the group laid out a definition for AI technology that respects basic human values and is engineered in a way that prevents it from causing intentional or unintentional harm. Such \u201ctrustworthy artificial intelligence\u201d will be the silver bullet in Europe\u2019s plan to catch up with the U.S. or China , the EU is convinced: Developing technology that adheres to high ethical standards will turn into a competitive advantage for European manufacturers, with consumers eventually preferring their products over those produced by competitors in China or the U.S., the strategy goes. Europe\u2019s 52 top AI specialists also take a clear stand against a controversial suggestion that robots should legally be considered \u201cpersons\u201d to make them liable for their actions. \u201cWe urge policymakers to refrain from establishing legal personality for AI systems or robots,\u201d the document states.\u201cWe believe this to be fundamentally inconsistent with the principle of human agency, accountability and responsibility, and to pose a significant moral hazard.\u201d", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "AI experts call to curb mass surveillance"}

On Wednesday, a U.K. court dismissed a case brought against the South Wales Police over its use of live facial recognition technology, which allows police to scan the faces of thousands of individuals in real time and match their likenesses against a database of suspects. In its ruling, the court argued that the use of such technology is covered by existing law, rejecting arguments brought by privacy campaigner Ed Bridges and the London-based advocacy group Liberty that the tool\u2019s deployment amounts to a violation of human rights and data protection law. Speaking in High Court, Lord Justice Haddon-Cave said that \"the current legal regime is adequate to ensure the appropriate and non-arbitrary use of AFR Locate\" \u2014 the technology used by South Wales Police. The decision, which marks a first in European courts, deals a blow to Bridges and other campaigners who say that large-scale deployment of facial recognition by police has a cooling effect on protesters and ultimately poses a threat to democratic freedoms. At a time when pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have been filmed sawing down facial recognition \u201ctowers\u201d in an effort to avoid detection and arrest, the ruling suggests that courts in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe may not stand in the way of further so-called experiments with the technology by police across the European Union, despite the bloc\u2019s far-reaching privacy protections. Indeed, as the ruling underscores, Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes exemptions for the collection of biometric data like facial likenesses by authorities, even though such information is considered \u201csensitive\u201d and highly restricted in the hands of private companies. Reacting to the ruling, Britain\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office warned about the risks of deploying a technology which it termed \u201cintrusive\u201d and which has the potential, \u201cif used without the right privacy safeguards, to undermine rather than enhance confidence in the police.\u201d The watchdog added that it would take the court\u2019s findings into account when formulating new guidance for police following the conclusion of an investigation into police use of facial recognition. Elsewhere in the EU, privacy watchdogs will also be paying attention to the ruling. From high schools in France to football stadiums in Copenhagen and a train station in Berlin , police are charging ahead with similar experiments with facial recognition, prompting activists, lawmakers and officials at the European Commission to call for clearer guidelines on how the tools can be deployed and what safeguards police must provide for privacy. After the city of San Francisco banned public use of facial recognition, the incoming Commission is examining ways to restrict the technology\u2019s deployment and limit broadening surveillance of European citizens, according to documents obtained by POLITICO. Despite the adverse ruling, Bridges has started a debate that could well end up being decided on the other side of the Channel. \u201cWe\u2019re very likely to see facial recognition before the European Court of Human Rights,\u201d said Daragh Murray, a human rights law expert at the University of Essex, adding: \"And this may well be the first instance.\" Liverpool FC fan vs Big Brother Advocates of automatic facial recognition underscore its potential to improve public safety. Former U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid referred to the technology as \u201cgame-changing\u201d in the fight against child abusers, as did Chris Phillips, former head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office. \u201cIf there are hundreds of people walking the streets who should be in prison because there are outstanding warrants for their arrest, or dangerous criminals bent on harming others in public places, the proper use of AFR has a vital policing role,\" Phillips said in May. But critics see a sinister potential. At least 18 countries are now importing the Chinese technology that Beijing uses to racially profile and closely track the country\u2019s 11 million Uighurs, a Muslim minority in China\u2019s northwest, amid reports that the technology disproportionately misidentifies ethnic minorities. \u201cIt can be used for really noble and well-meaning ends, but it can also be used maliciously, and it can also be used for well-intended purposes that have very serious social consequences,\u201d said Karen Yeung, a University of Birmingham Law professor and AI expert. In Europe, police use of facial recognition is set to expand in the absence of any overarching legal framework. And as Ed Bridges\u2019 lawsuit shows, average citizens are severely limited in their ability to contest or refuse facial recognition in public when police are behind the cameras. His campaign started back in December of 2017, when the Welsh office worker noticed a police van marked with the words \u201cfacial recognition\u201d parked on Cardiff\u2019s main thoroughfare and decided to investigate. The U.K. Home Office had awarded the South Wales Police almost \u00a32 million in January 2017 to trial AFR. The force initially deployed the technology \u2014 supplied by Japanese firm NEC \u2014 at a large football event in Cardiff in May and June of 2017, and has subsequently used AFR over 50 times. Compelled by basic misgivings about the technology, Bridges agreed to be the main complainant in a high-profile lawsuit against the South Wales Police launched in May of this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake up one morning and think, I really want to take my local police service to court,\u201d Bridges told POLITICO during an interview in Cardiff ahead of the court decision. \u201cBut sometimes you just find you\u2019re the right person at the right time to take something forward.\u201d A family man and fan of Liverpool Football Club who served for 13 years on his local council as a Liberal Democrat, Bridges in many ways embodies the regular citizen up against increasingly powerful surveillance tools that track our movements on the internet and in the streets. Having tried and failed to get the South Wales Police to cease their use of facial recognition until a full review had been completed, he took on the role of complainant in a legal challenge being brought by Liberty. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s shy about putting their head above the parapet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an important issue and I don\u2019t mind being the person who raises it.\u201d At the heart of Bridges' effort was the argument that automatic facial recognition has no explicit legal basis in the U.K. While commercial uses of AFR are subject to strict regulation under the GDPR, that regime doesn\u2019t always apply to police. Under a separate EU directive, law enforcement agencies can process biometric data without consent in certain circumstances. In the meantime, the use of facial recognition tools is expanding. Last month, the South Wales Police announced the trial of a new app for police officers \u2014 one that allows them to snap pictures of persons of interest and run them against a watch list on the spot.", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "UK court backs police in facial recognition lawsuit"}

With its pebble beaches and iconic Promenade des Anglais boardwalk, the Riviera city of Nice is best-known as a holiday destination favored by tourists and well-heeled French retirees. But the city is carving out another niche under the leadership of right-wing mayor Christian Estrosi \u2014 as a testing ground for high-tech surveillance tools that are alarming digital rights activists, testing the boundaries of European privacy law and setting parents on edge. The deployment of more than 2,600 CCTV cameras was just a first step. In February, Nice became the first French city to start trialing facial recognition tools in its streets thanks to cameras that scanned the faces of thousands of adults attending a carnival, matching their likenesses against a database of faces as part of a large-scale experiment. Now, the regional authority that runs schools around Nice is waiting for an opinion from regulators for another first: deploying facial recognition at the entrances of two regional high schools, in an experiment that has led to howls of protest from parents, teachers' unions and privacy activists. As France's CNIL privacy watchdog deliberates the question \u2014 the cameras are paused pending its opinion \u2014 Nice's surveillance drive under Estrosi is feeding a broader debate about the growing use of facial recognition in public and its effect on civil liberties. Championed by security hawks as a crime-fighting tool, the technology has nonetheless been banned in tech-savvy San Francisco, while earlier this month the California Senate outlawed the use of biometric tech for law enforcement amid fears of human rights violations and errors identifying women and minorities. On the other extreme, China's deployment of facial recognition tech is opening a window into a world of limitless surveillance. During pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong earlier this year, demonstrators sawed down towers equipped with face-scanning cameras to avoid detection by authorities. Meanwhile, Muslim Uighur minorities in the Chinese hinterland face such constant biometric surveillance that the New York Times has dubbed their region a \"technological prison .\" Europe, as Nice's example shows, has yet to make up its mind. While the Continent last year passed the world's most stringent privacy rules , known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), security forces enjoy plenty of wiggle room to use facial recognition. \"Experiments\" with the tool have popped up recently in France, Denmark, Germany and the U.K., where a court in August rejected Europe's first major legal challenge against police use of facial recognition. Privacy watchdogs are paying close attention. Earlier this year, Europe's data protection authorities warned that facial recognition entails \u201cheightened risks \u201d for fundamental rights and freedoms. But in the absence of tighter rules for authorities, tough-talking leaders like Nice's Estrosi are bound to press ahead. \u201cNice is one of those towns where political leaders have built their careers by embodying security, by developing city police and video surveillance,\u201d said Laurent Mucchielli, a sociologist and director of research at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), whose work focuses on crime and urban security. \"Facial recognition is the latest technology gadget that goes with video surveillance.\" \u2018France\u2019s most heavily watched city\u2019 Nice's love affair with high-tech surveillance stretches back nearly a decade \u2014 long before the 2016 terrorist attack that killed 87 people, including the attacker. In 2010 Estrosi, a minister under Nicolas Sarkozy, was the first mayor to create a sophisticated video surveillance system with a \u201curban supervision center\u201d in a French town. A longtime advocate of facial recognition, he unsuccessfully asked for government authorization in 2016 to deploy such technologies during the European football championship, before the GDPR existed. Today, the country\u2019s fifth biggest city in terms of population is de facto \u201cFrance\u2019s most heavily watched city,\u201d with more than 2,600 cameras installed on the street \u2014 one for every 128 inhabitants, and an increase of 1,111 percent since 2007. \u201cTechnology is crucially helpful to secure the everyday life of citizens,\u201d said an official from Nice's town hall. \u201cSecurity does not only consist of the protection of people\u2019s goods. It extends to a whole panel of dangers\" and can help police officers find \u201ca lost child, a person suffering from Alzheimer's or a wanted person,\" the official added. During the carnival in February, Nice partnered with the Monaco-based cybersecurity company Confidentia, which provided its \"Any Vision\" software free of charge to test the effectiveness of the algorithms. Confidentia did not reply to requests for comment. Under the GDPR, Nice did not need prior authorization from the CNIL, although the data protection authority asked for an assessment of the test once it was completed. During the trial, one of the carnival\u2019s entrances was equipped with facial recognition cameras that scanned the volunteers\u2019 faces in real time and matched them with a database. More than 5,000 people agreed to participate. Minors were not allowed to take part. According to the city\u2019s evaluation, obtained by French newspaper Le Monde , two scenarios were tested: a case-by-case control to assess whether people were authorized to access the carnival and more general scanning to detect the presence of specific volunteers in the crowd. The experiment was deemed a success by the city authorities. But the CNIL asked for more information to be able to properly assess the test, such as the rates of false positives and false negatives. Estrosi declined a request for an interview. The City of Nice declined to comment on the experiment and said the mayor would provide a full assessment in the coming weeks. Estrosi is hoping to run for reelection in 2020. For digital rights non-profit organization la Quadrature du Net , Estrosi's surveillance drive is handing the keys of the city to tech companies , to the detriment of the citizens' fundamental rights. \u201cIn the name of a supposedly smarter and safer city, private companies are selling their 'Safe City' projects, with increased surveillance of the urban space, to elected officials who lack imagination,\u201d said Martin Drago, a legal expert at the organization. Nice is an \"emblem\" of that phenomenon, he added. Outcry in high schools Testing facial recognition in high schools has proved a harder pill to swallow for Nice's inhabitants. In December 2018, the South Region, which has authority over high schools, decided to allow a facial recognition test in two high schools, one in Nice and one in Marseille. The regional body is chaired by Renaud Muselier, a former member of the European Parliament from Les R\u00e9publicains, the same political party as Nice Mayor Estrosi. Muselier did not reply to requests for comment. The project called for the installation of biometric portals in front of Les Eucalyptus high school in Nice and the Amp\u00e8re high school in Marseille. Students who agree to participate in the experiment will fill in consent forms and go through the biometric portal to enter the school. But NGOs, teachers' unions and parents are waging a campaign to stop the deployment of the biometric portals. Several organizations filed a suit in February before a court in Marseille to annul the region's decision. The case is ongoing. \u201cWe are convinced that the security of our children is not the main goal, but that there are commercial and political interests,\u201d said Laetitia Siccardi, who represents the federation of councils of students\u2019 parents. The experimentation was supposed to begin in September, but hasn\u2019t started yet. \u201cThe project is on standby while we wait for the CNIL [privacy authority],\u201d said Philippe Albert, the principal of Nice's Les Eucalyptus high school. According to the region's decision, the facial recognition test \u2014 part of a \u20ac45 million package to make high schools safer \u2014 aims to streamline student identification, fight identity theft and detect intruders. The technology is provided free of charge by U.S. tech company Cisco, which signed a memorandum of understanding with the region. Ga\u00ebtan Feige, who is in charge of innovation at Cisco France, said the planned system was protective of students' biometric data. \u201cThe biometric profiles of each student who will have given their consent will be kept temporarily on a database inside the high school,\u201d he said. The students\u2019 personal data, which won\u2019t be transferred to the cloud and will be individually encrypted, will be erased when they decide to stop participating in the test. The CNIL will give an opinion about the experiment around mid-October, said Thomas Dautieu, the data protection authority\u2019s director for compliance. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is to determine whether using facial recognition in high schools is justified.\u201d If the experiment gets the green light, it will be a first in France. In August, the Swedish data protection authority fined a high school under the GDPR because it was using facial recognition, arguing the students\u2019 consent could not be freely given because the school administration has a moral authority over them. \u2018Outdated\u2019 legal framework In Brussels, the European Commission suggested over the summer a future EU-wide legal instrument on goods and services powered by artificial intelligence, including facial recognition. But on the national level, La Quadrature du Net's Drago decries a lack of public debate about facial recognition. \u201cIn France, there is no debate on those technologies and the impact they can have on our rights and freedoms,\u201d he said. \"The GDPR is too vast, too vague, and is not enough,\" he added. While the GDPR applies for the use of facial recognition in high schools, deploying such technology in the context of criminal offenses, for example to track down people sought by the police, requires a decree from the Council of State built on an opinion from the CNIL. \u201cThe legal framework for facial recognition in public spaces is a bit outdated,\u201d conceded Dautieu from the CNIL. \u201c[Facial recognition] is a growth market and companies are providing their services, but it is high time the legislators dealt with the issue,\u201d he said. Unlike in California, there is so far little appetite in the French parliament for a ban on facial recognition tools. Instead, MPs have called for a legislative framework on experimentation with such technology. For the CNRS's Mucchielli, a legal framework is \"fundamental.\" \u201cThe development of technologies of control benefits from the weight of a technology myth in the Western psyche: That technology necessarily means progress, and is necessarily more effective than humans,\u201d he said.

{"_id": "227715390929_10157801374590930", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) \u2013 especially machine learning \u2013 is a technology that is spreading rapidly around the world. AI will become a standard tool to help steer cars, improve medical care or automate decision making within public authorities. Although intelligent technologies are drivers of innovation and growth, the global proliferation of them is already causing serious harm in its wake. Last month, a leaked white paper showed that the European Union is considering putting a until the potential risks are better understood. But many AI technologies in addition to facial recognition warrant more concern, especially from European policymakers. More and more experts have scrutinised the threat that 'Deep Fake' technologies may pose to democracy by enabling artificial disinformation; or consider the Apple Credit Card which grants much higher credit scores to husbands when compared to their wives, even though they share assets. Global companies, governments, and international organisations have reacted to these worrying trends by creating AI ethics boards, charters, committees, guidelines, etcetera, all to address the problems this technology presents - and Europe is no exception. The to draft guidelines on ethical AI. Unfortunately, an ethical debate alone will not help to remedy the destruction caused by the rapid spread of AI into diverse facets of life. The latest example of this shortcoming is Microsoft, one of the largest producers of AI-driven services in the world. Microsoft, who has often tried to set itself apart from its Big Tech counterparts as being a moral leader, has recently taken heat for its substantial investment in facial recognition software that is used for surveillance purposes. \"AnyVision\" is . Although investing in this technology goes directly against Microsoft's own declared ethical principles on facial recognition, there is no redress. It goes to show that governing AI - especially exported technologies or those deployed across borders - through ethical principles does not work. The case with Microsoft is only a drop in the bucket. Numerous cases will continue to pop up or be uncovered in the coming years in all corners of the globe \u2013 given a functioning and free press, of course. This problem is especially prominent with , as the European debate reflects. Developed in Big Tech, facial recognition products have been procured by government agencies such as customs and migration officers, police officers, security forces, the military, and more. This is true for many regions of the world: like in America, the UK, as well as several states in Africa, Asia, and more. Promising more effective and accurate methods to keep the peace, law enforcement agencies have adopted the use of AI to super-charge their capabilities. This comes with specific dangers, though, which is shown in numerous reports from advocacy groups and watchdogs saying that the technologies are flawed and deliver more false matches disproportionately for women and darker skin tones. If law enforcement agencies know that these technologies have the potential to be more harmful to subjects who are more often vulnerable and marginalised, then there should be adequate standards for implementing facial recognition in such sensitive areas. Ethical guidelines \u2013 neither those coming from Big Tech nor those coming from international stakeholders \u2013 are not sufficient to safeguard citizens from invasive, biased, or harmful practices of police or security forces. Although these problems have surrounded AI technologies in previous years, this has not yet resulted in a successful regulation to make AI \"good\" or \"ethical\" \u2013 terms that mean well but are incredibly hard to define, especially on an international level. This is why, even though actors from private sector, government, academia, and civil society have all been calling for ethical guidelines in AI development, these discussions remain vague, open to interpretation, non-universal, and most importantly, unenforceable. In order to stop the faster-is-better paradigm of AI development and remedy some of the societal harm already caused, we need to establish rules for the use of AI that are reliable and enforceable. And arguments founded in ethics are not strong enough to do so; ethical principles fail to address these harms in a concrete way. International human rights to rescue? As long as we lack rules that work, we should at least use guidelines that already exist to protect vulnerable societies to the best of our abilities. This is where the international human rights legal framework could be instrumental. We should be discussing these undue harms as violations of human rights, utilising international legal frameworks and language that has far-reaching consensus across different nations and cultural contexts, is grounded in consistent rhetoric, and is in theory enforceable. AI development needs to promote and respect human rights of individuals everywhere, not continue to harm society at a growing pace and scale. There should be baseline standards in AI technologies, which are compliant with human rights. Documents like the and the which steer private sector behaviour in human-rights compliant ways need to set the bar internationally. This is where the EU could lead by example. By refocusing on these existing conventions and principles, Microsoft's investment in AnyVision, for example, would be seen as not only a direct violation of its internal principles, but also as a violation of the UN Guiding Principles, forcing the international community to scrutinise the company's business activities more deeply and systematically, ideally leading to redress. Faster is not better. Fast development and dissemination of AI systems has led to unprecedented and irreversible damages to individuals all over the world. AI does, indeed, provide huge potential to revolutionise and enhance products and services, and this potential should be harnessed in a way that benefits everyone.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "Why EU will find it difficult to legislate on AI"}

Even though AI legislation in Europe and the US is only starting to be addressed by public authorities, big tech companies are already asking to set common standards across the globe. After a draft white paper about the EU's position on AI regulation was leaked earlier this month, Google chief Sundar Pichai, on Monday (20 January), warned the bloc about imposing its own regulations and called for an \"international alignment\" on the core values of the future laws of the sector. However, ahead of what is expected to be the fourth industrial revolution, the European Commission wants to ensure an \"appropriate\" ethical and legal framework for the development of AI, which promises to boost innovation while making EU citizens' rights a priority. In November, commission chief Ursula von der Leyen AI legislation similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU law on privacy. \"It is not about damming up the flow of data, it is about making rules that define how to handle data responsibly,\" she told MEPs back then. \"For us, the protection of a person's digital identity is the overriding priority,\" she added. According to Ursula Pachl, deputy director-general at the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), an NGO in Brussels, \"it is important that the European Commission has announced a legislative framework and is vocal about the ambition to become a global standard-setter in this area, much like it has done with the GDPR on data protection\". However, according to the commission's draft white paper - seen by EUobserver - this upcoming framework is likely to be built on existing legislation and risk-assessment or requirements for specific applications of these technologies rather than to plump for global sectoral requirements or bans. Three 'promising' options The leaked proposal suggests a few options that the commission is still considering for regulating the use of AI more generally - mainly to avoid breaches of fundamental rights, on safety issues, and on liability risks. These include a voluntary labelling framework for developers (based on voluntary previsions for technology makers with binding conditions), imposing sectoral requirements for public administration (including the use of facial recognition), or mandatory risk-based requirement for \"high-risk\" applications (in sectors such as health care, policing, or transport). The commission is also expected to amend existing EU safety and liability legislation to address the new risks. The draft white paper emphasises the need to oversee the implementation and application of this technology to ensure compliance with EU law, although it says member states should decide whether to rely on existing authorities or create new bodies for the regulation of AI. The text inidcates that mandatory requirement for \"high-risk\" applications, amendments to EU law and public enforcement are the most \"promising\" options to address the risks specific to AI. However, some might say that while the EU wants to set the standards, , especially in comparison to the US, where more \"flexible frameworks\" can be expected. A ban? 'Not likely' Additionally, the leaked proposal floats the idea of a three-to-five-year period in which the use of facial recognition technologies could be banned in public places to identify and address the possible risks of this technology. However, \"such a ban would be a far-reaching measure that might hamper the development and uptake of this technology,\" the commission writes, adding that \"it would be preferable to focus on the full implementation of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]\". \"The face recognition ban is mentioned in the paper, but the authors write twice that this approach is not recommended, [so] the European Commission might be 'considering' a ban, but it does not look like they will push for it,\" said Nicolas Kayser-Bril from NGO AlgorithmWatch. The draft proposal highlights that such a ban will also necessarily foresee . Meanwhile, this regulatory safeguard could face opposition from many member states that have deployed these technologies, including Germany, France or Hungary. According to Diego Naranjo, head of policy at NGO European Digital Rights (EDRi), \"member states should stop deploying [facial recognition] technologies until specific EU legislation is adopted. \"There is no innovation in deploying mass surveillance of citizens. China is already doing it very effectively, while the US has developed the largest surveillance system worldwide as exposed by Snowden in his revelations,\" he added. The European Commission is expected to unveil the white paper on the EU's apporach towards AI in mid-February and some of its policy recommendations are likely to change in the meantime.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "EU keen to set global rules on artificial intelligence"}

The points out that the risk of errors and data leakages raises fundamental rights concerns related to privacy, human dignity, personal data protection or non-discrimination. For example, the use of facial recognition technologies during demonstrations might create \"a chilling effect\", preventing people from exercising their freedom of assembly, expression or association, said Diego Naranjo, head of policy at NGO European Digital Rights (EDRi). \"Until the necessity and proportionality of the use of these technologies for \"security\" purposes are proven, governments must refrain from using them,\" he added. However, more and more European countries have been testing these technologies in the last few years by law-enforcement authorities. The to identify people in real-time with street cameras. Earlier this year, the , Datainspektionen, authorised police to use facial recognition to help identify criminals. In Hungary, a project called Szitak\u00f6t\u0151 (dragonfly) plans to deploy in Budapest, and across the country. But, according to the senior legal officer at the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), David Martin, \"consumers should be told when companies or governments use facial recognition, having the chance to say no\". Facial recognition in EU The international police agency Interpol has been using this technology since 2016. Yet, the deployment of facial-recognition systems is expected to be used on a large scale in European technical systems for asylum, migration and security purposes, for example, when applying for a visa, crossing the border or requesting asylum, the FRA report states. The report identifies six major IT systems used by the EU, five of which are set to process facial images for migration and security, including the Schengen information system or the entry-exit system. The accuracy of this technology is mainly based on the data quality used to create the software, and the quality of data used when is deployed, states the report. However, the risk that errors may lead to discrimination of certain minorities raises concerns among civil society. \"It could be the case that facial recognition technology dramatically increases the number of false positives, for example, people arrested although they have not committed a crime,\" said Nicolas Kayser-Bril from , who believes that there is little evidence that facial recognition helps the fight against crime. Facial images constitute \"biometric data\", EU law states, as they can be used to identify individuals. As a result, video surveillance carried out by the law enforcement authorities for prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, exercising many GDPR rights requires that \"the person is aware that their personal data are stored there\", FRA report points out. Call for legislation In June, the EU's high-level expert group on Artificial Intelligence (AI) put forward a set of recommendations and ethical principles for the use of these technologies, including facial recognition, which is currently \"being tested,\" the commission spokesperson said earlier this year. One of the critical concerns listed in the document is the \"automatic identification [of individuals]\" because \"it raises strong concerns of both a legal and ethical nature\". \"Individuals should not be subject to unjustified personal, physical or mental tracking or identification, profiling and nudging through AI-powered methods of biometric recognition such as: emotional tracking, empathic media, DNA, iris, and behavioural identification, affect recognition, voice, and facial recognition and the recognition of micro-expressions,\" the expert group said. Application of facial recognition technologies \"must be clearly warranted in existing law,\" where the legal basis for such activity should be the consent of the data subject, it added. However, the FRA report points out that \"a clear legal framework must regulate the deployment and use of facial recognition technologies\" - although monitoring by independent supervisory bodies is also needed. The EU commission president-elect Ursula von der Leyen said that she will put forward on the human and ethical implications of artificial intelligence within the first 100 days of her mandate. However, NGO Algorithm Watch believes that the commission's fast-track for AI legislation will likely leave many aspects of automated decision-making to one side.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "EU warned over fast-tracking facial recognition"}

And without finally having an open and inclusive public conversation about them, we risk losing the democratic legitimacy of these transformations. The evolution of government surveillance is bold, multi-faceted, and confusing. Agencies across the continent are deploying an avalanche of new technologies, notably machine learning, to both advance new capabilities such as biometric surveillance and master long-standing challenges like information overload. New institutions of intelligence cooperation and comprehensive data-sharing arrangements are implemented at multiple levels, across jurisdictions, and with greater-than-ever corporate involvement. At the same time, the EU is itself advancing an ambitious new surveillance agenda and is investing heavily in security research. And while national and European courts still grapple with questions of legality, territoriality, and privacy brought about by the previous round of intelligence laws, parliamentarians across Europe are already debating new intelligence bills that aim to grant agencies even greater intrusive surveillance powers. New technology is driving the transformation Whereas the proliferation of data mushroomed with the widespread integration of digital devices into people's everyday lives, advanced surveillance equipment allows intelligence agencies to collect that data at unprecedented scale and in real time. Artificial intelligence can then help them get a grip on the sheer volume, velocity, and complexity of modern data analysis. It remains entirely unclear, however, whether existing legal frameworks cover the use of such technologies. Automated and machine-learned cues for offensive cyber operations might enhance the services' effectiveness, but they also require much more attention to unresolved questions around rights infringements, operational accountability, and oversight. Using facial recognition software, the city of Nice, one of many trial locations in Europe, may be able to identify attendants of a carnival. But should democracies collect the most personal of personal data this aggressively, let alone act upon it? Naturally, new means of data collection from a growing pool of sources - and the convergence of surveillance technology in intelligence, law enforcement, and the military - prompt ever-closer working relations across sectors and countries in Europe. However, they also should - and regrettably often do not - occasion new ways of structuring liability and oversight. Consider, for instance, the Counter Terrorism Group's operative platform in The Hague where 30 different intelligence services submit data into a giant database, without clear rules for who is liable for wrongly imputed or corrupt data that can have real adverse human consequences. Oversight While there are good reasons for intense intelligence sharing, it is problematic when each service, as is currently the case, is accountable only to its national oversight bodies. Not only do these institutions typically review but a fraction of their respective agencies' international activities, even the best national oversight structure would be unable to rein in joint intelligence action on its own. Some might say that intelligence, once known as the last bastion of national sovereignty, has become an arena of collusive delegation. The response has to be multilateral oversight however tricky this may be to administer. Similarly, at the EU level, national datasets are being operationalised into new \"cross-information analysis platforms\". Recent examples of this include the Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust, the Inspectr project, and the European Search Portal. With the latter, personal profiles based on fingerprints and facial images stored in the free-travel Schengen Zone security systems and data from joint police agencies Europol and Interpol can be accessed by an increasingly large amount of officials across the EU. According to the European Commission, more than \u20ac1bn are earmarked for these and other massive 'interoperability' projects until 2027. By rendering vast amounts of personal data even more accessible for law enforcement, border, and intelligence agencies across jurisdictions, Europe further erodes already waned demarcation lines between operational agencies and those that are collecting information about potential threats. Worrying This is a worrying development. In some instances, notably Austria and Latvia, police and intelligence functions are already performed by a single agency. Granting inter-jurisdictional access and pushing for greater interoperability will do away with important firewalls that history has wisely dictated in some countries. Currently, our open societies - the ones that are meant to benefit from this development - have far too little information, let alone say, on this agenda. Moreover, our oversight and data protection bodies have yet to catch up on the technological revolution. Their audit and review mechanisms, for example, are everything but fully synced, automated, and comprehensive. This invites abuse and does little to close ever-growing accountability gaps. If we want to protect fundamental rights and align European surveillance practices with our democratic principles, we need to start a meaningful public dialogue about the momentous changes that are taking place. With the stakes being so high and the potential for mutual learning so great, it is striking that people in the agencies and oversight bodies, government, civil society, business, and academia rarely engage in regular, open, and inclusive conversation on these matters. Given the complexity of security policy in a rapidly changing world, it may seem preferable to bury our heads in the sand and let the ones inside the ring of secrecy run the show. This, however, is a luxury that neither the people outside nor the people within the corridors of power can afford.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "Europe quietly becoming a spy superpower"}

The toolbox presents a set of guidelines designed to help EU member states mitigate potential risks arising from 5G technology while supporting the commission to ensure a \"diverse and sustainable\" 5G supply chain to avoid long-term dependency on third countries. Some of identified by EU member states are low equipment quality, espionage, dependency, or Internet of Things (IoT) exploitation. However, according to Vestager, \"this proposal protects our citizens and EU's digital sovereignty\". Following a risk-based approach, EU countries can apply restrictions for suppliers considered to be \"high risk\" and even exclude them from the core parts and sensible functions of their telecoms networks, the commission said. However, the institution did not identify any specific \"high risk\" company, despite the geopolitical tug of war over Huawei, which the US has completely banned from its 5G networks - and has been pushing its allies to do the same. \"One thing is clear: we're not picking on anybody, we're not ostracising firms,\" said the European commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton. This means that non-EU providers are welcome to do business in Europe as long as they comply with the rules, Breton said. Huawei's response China's Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of telecoms equipment, followed by Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. However, the three companies present \"notable differences\" in their corporate governance in terms of the level of transparency, according to the commission. Huawei welcomed the EU announcement, saying that Europe will benefit from this approach. \"This non-biased and fact-based approach towards 5G security allows Europe to have a more secure and faster 5G network,\" Huawei said in a statement. The presentation of the toolbox follows the and highly-regulated role in Britain's 5G networks, despite the pressure from Washington. Next steps The commission expects member states to have implemented the recommended measures by April this year. The EU's 5G action plan aims to have a simultaneous launch of services among EU member states, starting at the end of this year, and with a full roll-out in all member states by the end of 2025. According to the commission, 5G services will be available in 138 European cities by the end of this year. Additionally, the EU's executive body is already proposing a new institutional partnership under the next long-term EU budget (called Smart Network and Services) which will be working towards 6G, while the commission works with member states and with the parliament to ensure the rollout of 5G technologies - and its security.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "EU rules leave 5G networks open for Huawei"}

But the commission vice president Margarethe Vestager said only on Wednesday that the EU's executive body will launch \"a broad European debate to determine the specific circumstances, if any, which might justify the use\" of facial recognition. According to Naranjo, \"the proposed debate should lead to the prohibition of deployment of live facial recognition systems (and similar biometric technologies) in member states\". \"Facial recognition and biometric identification are enormously privacy-invasive and their use can bear many risks for consumers,\" said David Martin from the European Consumer Organisation, who added \"it would be careless to expand the use of this technology until all the necessary safeguards are in place\". The commission wants to ensure the adoption of across the EU by establishing new binding requirements for the development and use of \"high-risk\" applications. However, the risks of facial-recognition technologies, which make decisions based on image interpretation, vary depending on their purpose - for example, unblocking a smartphone does not pose a \"high risk\" for citizens' fundamental rights. What is 'high-risk'? All \"high-risk\" applications will have to comply with new rules, including high data quality and traceability obligations, human oversight and transparency standards throughout the whole development lifecycle of these technologies. However, the commission recognised that \"the lack of transparency [of AI systems] makes it difficult to identify and prove possible breaches of laws, including legal provisions that protect fundamental rights\". Additionally, facial recognition would be subject to requirements of 'proportionality' - an assessment to ensure that the technology is being used proportionally and with sufficient safeguards to protect individuals. \"AI can only be used for remote biometric identification [facial recognition] purposes where such use is duly justified, proportionate and subject to adequate safeguards,\" the commission's white paper on AI states. However, critics warned that these measures, aimed at reducing bias and error, fail to address the threats that the technology poses to citizens' privacy. \"Modern systems allow constant surveillance of people over long periods, which is simply not compatible with a free and democratic society,\" said MEP Alexandra Geese (Green/EFA), who is the rapporteur on the ethical aspects of AI for the parliament's internal market and consumer protection committee. \"The devil is in the detail - in the precise definition of high risk and in the possibilities to defend against discriminatory or inaccurate AI applications,\" she added. Policing the police? Last November, said that \"a clear legal framework must regulate the deployment and use of facial recognition technologies,\" warning that collecting facial images of individuals without their consent or chance to refuse \"can have a negative impact on people's dignity\". However, the commission considered that the basic legal framework for facial recognition might already be in place under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and prefers to focus on enforcement. As a rule, GDPR prohibits the processing of biometric data, such as facial images or fingerprints, without consent - unless a specific exception applies. However, more and more European countries have been testing these technologies in the last few years by law-enforcement authorities - raising concerns over privacy and discrimination risks. \"Police forces in almost all EU countries already use face recognition or plan to introduce it, and none of them is being fully transparent about their use,\" warned Nicolas Kayser-Bril from NGO AlgorithmWatch. Some of the member states that have tried or deployed facial-recognition technologies for security reasons include Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands. Last month, showed that the commission was considering a temporary ban on facial recognition technologies in public spaces to better understand its potential risks, but the proposal was quickly rejected. \"I want that digital Europe reflects the best of Europe \u2013 open, fair, diverse, democratic, and confident,\" said the commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who claim that \"AI must serve people and must always comply with people's rights\".", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "EU backtracks on plans to ban facial recognition"}

The three-year research, carried out by a coalition of 50 international institutions, states that \"the battle for our planet will be won or lost in cities\" - home of more than half of world's 7.5bn people. \"National governments have unique and crucial roles to play in nurturing zero-carbon, climate-resilient cities,\" according to the report, released ahead of the climate action summit in New York that will take place on 23 September. According to the EU commission, around 75 percent of Europeans live in cities, where \"climate change has the potential to influence almost all components of the urban environment\". In 2018, the commission presented its strategic long-term vision for the climate-neutral economy by 2050, which aims at an 80 percent reduction of EU domestic emissions by 2050 - in line with the Paris Agreement objective to keep the temperature increase to well below 2\u00b0C, and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5\u00b0C. However, a fossil-free campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, Molly Walsh, suggested that \"as long as the European Commission supports new fossil gas projects, and an energy charter treaty that blocks governments from transforming their energy, a zero-carbon Europe will be beyond reach.\" \"We need fast action now. CO2 must have a fair price. We urge the new European commission to make climate priority a reality and increase our CO2-reduction target from the weak 40 percent to at least 65 percent by 2030,\" said the head of the European Parliament delegation to the COP 25 in Santiago de Chile, Bas Eickhout. Local green initiatives The report indicates that high-carbon systems are expected to become unprofitable or inoperable since markets and regulations will evolve towards climate-friendly economies. \"National governments with the vision to invest in smart, sustainable cities today will see great returns on their investment,\" said professor of economics and government at London school of economics Nicholas Stern, adding that cities are \"a source of creativity and innovation\" that could lead climate transition. Besides the economic and environmental benefits, the research indicates that investment in low-carbon measures could support 87m jobs annually by 2030, in sectors such as clean energy and public transport. \"It is possible and realistic to realise net-zero urban emissions by 2050. But to get there, we will need the full engagement of city governments combined with national action and support,\" said secretary-general of the United Nations Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. German example According to the German minister of the environment Svenja Schulze, \"tackling the climate crisis and securing economic prosperity is possible\". However, local governments cannot carry out low-carbon transition by themselves, instead \"strong support of national governments is essential to unleash the full transformative potential of cities and towns,\" said Schulze. Germany's 'Energiewende' (Energy transition) is an example of how national governments can collaborate with municipalities, businesses, and citizens to accelerate low-carbon cities and foster the energy transition. As a result, Germany has expanded the share of renewable electricity from 6 percent to over 38 percent between 2000 and 2018, largely thanks to the renewable energy sources act, which empowered local authorities. Munich, for example, is planning to increase the city's renewable energy share from 39 percent in 2019 to 100 percent by 2025. According to the report, the success of the German Energiewende is based on having \"a comprehensive and ambitious national policy framework, strong national-local partnerships and large-scale citizen buy-in\".

Yesterday, we reported that the European Commission is working alongside Europol and EU member states to \u201cidentify appropriate ways of preserving lawful interception capabilities in 5G networks,\u201d according to Ylva Johansson, the EU\u2019s Home Affairs Commissioner. With 5G\u2019s 256-bit encryption, clandestine interception becomes technically challenging. As a result, for security services to obtain data for the purposes of criminal investigation, either software standards would have to be lowered, or backdoors would have to be built into the hardware. We caught up with MEP Cornelia Ernst to hear her thoughts on the subject. She told us that because 5G is designed the way it is, with connections encrypted by default all connections \u201cwill always look like they were genuinely encrypted using state-of-the-art technology.\u201d She added: \u201cThe result is that you cannot trust your connection to be as strongly protected as it seems.\u201d Read more here .

John Shanahan, director of Joint Artificial Intelligence Center at the U.S. Department of Defense, is in Brussels today for talks with EU and NATO officials. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Shanahan highlighted concerns with the use of some AI technologies, including facial recognition. \u201cUbiquitous social surveillance, facial recognition is an area that we have a concern about, used by authoritarian regimes. Again, it\u2019s not the technology itself I\u2019m worried about; it\u2019s how the technology is being used,\u201d he said. Despite this, Shanahan reiterated an earlier statement from the White House that the EU should avoid heavy regulation in the field of AI. Responding to a question from EURACTIV, he said: \u201cThe last thing we want to do in this field of emerging technology moving as fast as it is, is to stifle innovation. Over-regulating artificial intelligence is one way to stifle innovation and do it very quickly.\u201d Shanahan did, however, add that his government realise that \u201cself-regulation will not work everywhere all the time,\u201d and finding common ground with NATO and the EU in this regard was one of the objectives during his time in Brussels this week. Cybercrime Cybercrime . Yesterday, the EU delegation to the Council of Europe underlined their commitment to the CoE\u2019s Budapest Convention on cybercrime. \u201c We need to protect an open free, interoperable and secure Internet and to fight cybercrime by supporting its implementation and development,\u201d a statement from the EU read.

Fieke Jansen is a PhD candidate at the Data Justice Lab and Mozilla Foundation Fellow 2019-2020 . Daniel Leufer, PhD, is a Mozilla Foundation Fellow 2019-2020 hosted by Access Now and member of the Working Group on Philosophy of Technology at KU Leuven, Belgium. Discussions on the negative impact of Artificial Intelligence in society include horror stories plucked from either China\u2019s high-tech surveillance state and its use of the controversial social credit system , or from the US and its use of recidivism algorithms and predictive policing . Typically, Europe is excluded from these stories, due to the perception that EU citizens are protected from such AI-fueled nightmares through the legal protection offered by the GDPR, or because there is simply no horror-inducing AI deployed across the continent. In contrast to this perception, journalists and NGOs have shown that imperfect and ethically questionable AI systems such as facial recognition, fraud detection and smart (a.k.a surveillance) cities, are also in use across Europe . For example, the UK police are implementing facial recognition to monitor protests and soccer matches; the Dutch government is being sued for SyRI , a risk-scoring algorithm that is targeting the poor; and the Polish Ministry of Labour and Social Policy introduced a controversial system that profiles unemployed people to determine the type of assistance that a person can obtain from local labour offices. Meanwhile, AI systems like these are on track to proliferate this decade: one of the three \u2018pillars\u2019 of the European Commission\u2019s plan on AI is to boost \u201cAI uptake across the economy, both by the private and public sector.\u201d To that end, the Commission is investing in the development of AI systems through funding programs such as Horizon 2020, which will have invested nearly \u20ac80 billion of funding over 7 years (2014 to 2020), with a significant portion of that going to so-called \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 projects. According to last week\u2019s leaked white paper on AI regulation , there are plans to increase this funding and further invest in \u201ctargeted cloud-based artificial intelligence services,\u201d to \u201coffer world-leading master programs in artificial intelligence,\u201d and to ensure \u201caccess to finance for artificial intelligence innovators.\u201d Amid this proliferation, some EU residents might be comforted by the Commission\u2019s stated commitment to \u2018Trustworthy AI,\u2019 most notably through its Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and the potential influence they might have on the fabled \u2018AI Regulation\u2019 promised to come in the first 100 days of the new Commission mandate. Indeed, it seems clear that public procurement in general, and these EU funding mechanisms in particular, have huge potential to promote the development of \u2018trustworthy\u2019 AI systems: i.e. that respect human rights , adhere to ethical guidelines and promote human agency. Despite the EU\u2019s commitment to \u2018trustworthy\u2019 AI sounding noble, the history of technological investments made under Horizon 2020 casts doubt on these intentions. Take for example iBorderCtrl , a Horizon 2020-funded project that aims to create an automated border security system to detect deception based on facial recognition technology and the measurement of micro-expressions. In short, the EU spent \u20ac4.5 million on a project that \u2018detects\u2019 whether a visitor to the continent is lying or not by asking them 13 questions in front of a webcam. The historical practice of lie detection is lacking in substantial scientific evidence and the AI technologies being used here to analyse micro expressions are just as questionable . To make matters worse, the Commission is ignoring the transparency criteria outlined in the Ethics Guidelines by refusing to publish certain documents, including an ethics assessment, \u201c on the grounds that the ethics report and PR strategy are \u201ccommercial information\u201d of the companies involved and of \u201ccommercial value\u201d .\u201d Another example of untrustworthy AI funded by Horizon 2020 is the SEWA project . This project received \u20ac3.6 million to develop technology that can read the depths of human sentiment and emotions \u2018in the wild\u2019 \u2014 for the ultimate purpose of more effectively marketing products to consumers using an ad recommendation engine. Indeed, the SEWA project was singled out by Shoshana Zuboff in her book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism , as a pioneer in techniques harvesting personal data to be processed for behavioural prediction/manipulation. Not only is there doubt among the scientific community that human emotions can be reliably inferred from biometric analysis, but one can also question how \u2018trustworthy\u2019 is it to develop technology that exploits people\u2019s emotional states for commercial gain. In the leaked White Paper, the Commission is caught in a dilemma about whether or not to introduce a 3-5 year ban on facial recognition: on the one hand, such a ban would allow time to safeguard against any abuse, but on the other, they worry that a ban \u201cmight hamper the development and uptake of this technology.\u201d Just recently, the US\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios urged the EU to \u201c avoid heavy-handed innovation-killing models \u201d in its AI regulation, but we must ask seriously whether certain forms of innovation \u2013 in the domain of mass surveillance and pseudo-scientific lie detection \u2013 may not require a heavy hand. Some uses of AI could be by definition untrustworthy, and we need to see a commitment from the EU not to blindly promote \u2018AI uptake\u2019 without consideration of its impact. Projects such as iBorderCtrl and SEWA lead to larger questions: if the criteria to fund AI is not based on a technology\u2019s trustworthiness, ethics , or innovative capabilities, then which drivers inform these decisions? In the orientation for the first Strategic Plan for the Horizon Europe framework , the funding framework that succeeds Horizon 2020, the EU refers to co-design and public consultation. However, the co-design meeting was composed of speakers from universities, companies and governments across Europe who have a vested interest in Horizon Europe funding. This process is lacking critical engagement from impartial parties, like civil society, public interest groups or communities who would be affected by these \u2018innovative\u2019 projects. This indicates that the commitment to \u2018trustworthy\u2019 AI is toothless and what is needed is an honest, critical public debate on the emerging technology that will shape the future public life of Europe. Going forward, the EU must stand behind their commitment to \u2018trustworthy\u2019 AI by actively soliciting independent and critical voices in the strategy development process of Horizon Europe, disclosing how any proposed regulation on AI will be integrated into the funding criteria of Horizon Europe, and also engaging in a postmortem of Horizon 2020. The postmortem should analyze the extent to which projects funded under Horizon 2020 adhere to human rights standards and relevant ethical guidelines, as well as an analysis of the current processes and procedures to ensure that they are sufficiently safeguarding our fundamental rights.", "source_name": "EURACTIV", "title": "The EU is funding dystopian Artificial Intelligence projects"}

Although official confirmation of the plan is still missing, an alliance between civil society and politicians has called for the banning of this surveillance technology. EURACTIV Germany reports . According to DER SPIEGEL , Seehofer plans to equip 134 train stations and 14 airports with cameras capable of automatically identifying people in crowds in a bid to expand Germany\u2019s automatic facial recognition system. Although the ministry has not officially confirmed the measures, a government spokesman, asked by EURACTIV, stated that an amendment to the Federal Police Act was planned to provide the police with \u201cimproved technical possibilities and, where possible and reasonable, extended responsibilities\u201d. And the corresponding draft law should currently be the subject of \u201cinternal governmental coordination\u201d. Call for a ban Call for a ban But opposition to the plan is mounting. Viktor Schl\u00fcter, activist and founder of the \u201cDigital Freedom\u201d initiative, created the \u201cFace Recognition Stop\u201d alliance \u201cto show that many people strongly doubt the effectiveness and usefulness of these proposals,\u201d he explained to EURACTIV. Activist groups such as Chaos Computer Club and epicenter.works, alongside the media outlet netzpolitik.org, and also politicians, such as members of Die Linke , are among doubters. On 9 January the group presented its demands to the government. And they not only demand the alleged expansion of the facial recognition system planned by Seehofer to be stopped but also for a complete and final ban on automatic face recognition in public by the state. Error-prone Error-prone What is their motivation? According to Schl\u00fcter, it is because the currently available technology remains underdeveloped and could lead to misidentifications, so-called \u201cfalse positives\u201d. The interior ministry tested facial recognition cameras as early as 2018 at the Berlin-S\u00fcdkreuz station. The result was that 80% of the people were correctly identified. \u201cThe systems have impressively proven themselves so that a broad introduction is possible\u201d, Seehofer had said at the time. But the Chaos Computer Club, an activist hacker association, did the math and accused the ministry of whitewashing. According to the association, such a figure could only be obtained if all three technology providers worked simultaneously and supported each other, as the hit rate for a single provider was only 68.5%. I t\u2019s the SPD\u2019s turn t\u2019s the SPD\u2019s turn The leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), Saskia Esken, also warned against such false positives and made it clear on Twitter on 4 January: And with the bill in the hands of the SPD-led ministry of justice, the socialists will undoubtedly play a key role. Schl\u00fcter, however, remains realistic. Although he is pleased with Esken\u2019s positioning, Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht has \u201cin the past sometimes not been so pro-foundationalist\u201d, meaning he is concerned that the SPD could cave in. This could still, however, be an opportunity, as \u201cthe SPD is looking for a profile,\u201d meaning it could act \u201chere and now\u201d. Moreover, discrimination could also become a problem. A study by MIT in cooperation with Microsoft showed that false positives are more common among women, children and people with dark skin. That would be system-inherent discrimination. Last but not least, it is currently effortless to evade identification. Wanted persons would only have to turn their face 15 degrees away from the cameras or partially cover their faces to avoid being recognised. Chilling Effect Chilling Effect Although such technical problems could be resolved in the future, Schl\u00fcter and his group would reject even a perfectly functioning face recognition system for the public, which is why they are calling for a definitive ban. And that is because of public surveillance, in general, has a so-called \u2018chilling effect\u2019, according to them. \u201cWe see great danger in creeping self-restriction,\u201d said Schl\u00fcter, noting that constant surveillance forces people to adapt their behaviour. He considers this to be unhealthy for democracies since citizens may shy away from political participation, knowing their faces are being stored in relevant databases. No bad intentions No bad intentions However, Schl\u00fcter made it clear that the government is not being malicious in its intent. He acknowledged the deterring, rather than the preventative, effect of surveillance, noting that if one place is being monitored, handbags are stolen somewhere else. But Interior Minister Seehofer sees it differently. After the 2018 tests, he said facial recognition systems would \u201cmake police work even more efficiently, thus improving security for citizens\u201d. The ball is now in the SPD\u2019s court.

In terms of how the momentum of 2019 could propel the direction of EU policy this year, this is our take on what could be in store, in what will prove to be a \u2018geopolitical\u2019 12 months for digital policy. /// Digital Services Digital Services The European Commission is currently in the process of thrashing out the details of the Digital Services Act (DSA) Digital Services Act (DSA) , a new framework due to be put forward in 2020, which will update the decades-old eCommerce directive and establish new rules governing the internet. The DSA is likely to include measures aimed to tackle illegal content online and political advertising across platforms, as well as establishing an EU definition of hate speech hate speech . Adopting a common approach on hate speech at the EU level will be no mean feat, as differing interpretations on the concept have been manifesting recently. On 19 December 2019, the German justice ministry released a draft law German justice ministry released a draft law to combat right-wing extremism and hate crime \u2013 which ramps up the legal obligation under the German Network Enforcement Act for social media providers active in Germany to delete hate speech, so that such firms would now be required to proactively report offending content to the authorities. In France, the National Assembly National Assembly approved draft legislation on hate speech in July, a revised version of which went through the senate in December after having removed a 24-hour removal order obligation. Commission Vice President for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 said towards the end of the year that the French should hold tight on the plans for now, while the Commission puts the final touches to the Digital Service Act framework. A important point on the DSA, is the fact that the Commission proposal is unlikely to re-open the liability exemptions in the e-Commerce Directive, which had been put in place to protect hosting providers. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether disinformation and fake news disinformation and fake news will come under the scope of the digital services act. Last year, the Commission put into action the code of practice against disinformation \u2013 a voluntary framework that aimed to stamp out the spread of fake news online. Signatories included Facebook, Google and Twitter. However, throughout the review process, Commissioners frequently criticised the lack of oversight by some of the platforms. Should disinformation continue to cause worry in terms of the integrity and independence of European elections, regulators in Brussels may very well consider more stringent measures to ensure that fake news is not given the space to foster online. In another area of the digital services ecosystem, trilogue negotiations are still ongoing as part of the EU\u2019s online terrorist content regulation online terrorist content regulation , which aims to force internet companies to remove content promoting terrorism. There are several crucial areas of negotiation ongoing, including the timeframe of the removal orders and potential exemptions for educational, journalistic or research work. /// Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has pledged to deliver a strategy on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics in the first 100 days of the new Commission. An EU source recently told EURACTIV that we are likely to see a \u2018roadmap\u2019 rather than a tightly defined strategy, as part of the announcement. A report published in June by the Commission\u2019s High-Level Group on AI Commission\u2019s High-Level Group on AI suggested that the EU should consider the need for new regulation to \u201censure adequate protection from adverse impacts,\u201d which could include issues arising from biometric recognition, the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), AI systems built on children\u2019s profiles, and the impact AI may have on fundamental rights. Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders told his parliamentary hearing in October he would advocate for an \u2018ethics-by-design\u2019 \u2018ethics-by-design\u2019 approach, whereby products and services using AI take into account ethical guidelines at the earliest possible stage in their development. Moreover, appearing at the European Parliament\u2019s Knowledge and Big Data Innovation Summit in December, Lucilla Sioli, director of Artificial Intelligence and digital industry at DG CONNECT, suggested the EU\u2019s plans in the field of AI could help foster an environment that would bolster European technology. \u201cThere are technical reasons, together with the complexity of our geopolitical context that really call for us to be able to develop a lot of these key technologies,\u201d she said. Another area which hasn\u2019t received much attention so far in the field of AI is how the technology will impact intellectual property rights. When AI is used to compose a work of art or create music, who owns the work? Should AI-generated works always be in the public domain? Some of these questions will only become more pertinent in 2020. Following on from this, the EU\u2019s copyright directive, adopted last year, will begin to be transposed in more countries across the bloc in 2020. Due to the divisiveness of the reforms, the nature or manner of how the measures will be transposed will be of interest. We already conducted a (partial) overview of how things stood towards the end of 2019. /// Facial Recognition Facial Recognition One AI technology that will continue to raise concerns is facial recognition. Last year, the Swedish Data Protection Authority fined a Swedish Data Protection Authority fined a municipality 20,000 euros for using facial recognition technology to monitor the attendance of students in school \u2013 the first fine issued by the Swedish DPA, and indicative of how attitudes towards facial recognition may be coloured over the next five years in Europe. Meanwhile, France\u2019s data regulator, the CNIL France\u2019s data regulator, the CNIL , said the technology breaches consent rules outlined in the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which states that users must give their permission before their biometric data can be stored. In France, however, the issue is not so clear cut, President Emmanuel Macron has been keen to rally the benefits of his country\u2019s new ID programme, \u2018 Alicem Alicem \u2019, which employs facial recognition technologies for identity verification purposes. That being said, France\u2019s Secretary of State for Digital, C\u00e9dric O, France\u2019s Secretary of State for Digital, C\u00e9dric O, was wary about the project actually gaining traction, in an interview with Le Parisien . In Brussels, the European Data Protection Supervisor, Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski, voiced a number of concerns with facial recognition technologies just before taking up the post in December, in a blog post where he highlighted the possible privacy and data protection issues. Margarethe Vestager\u2019s approach to AI is cautious, but not overly prohibitive. She told EURACTIV in November that \u201cgreat opportunities come with great risks,\u201d but that she has \u201cstrong reservations\u201d with the \u2018blanket\u2019 application of some technologies in particular, such as facial recognition software. /// 5G 5G In December, EU ministers adopted conclusions concerning the importance and security of 5G technology, stressing that an approach to 5G cybersecurity should be comprehensive and risk-based, while also taking into account \u2018non-technical factors\u2019. An important statement amid continuing pressure from the US administration on policymakers and regulators in Europe, who are yet to form a unified position the involvement of telecommunications giant Huawei. In the Commission, an October report on the coordinated risk assessment of 5G networks noted that \u201cthreats posed by states or state-backed actors are perceived to be of highest relevance\u201d. Member states have now been tasked with working on a set of measures to mitigate the cybersecurity risks outlined in the report. EU nations are currently working alongside the Commission and ENISA, the European Agency for Cybersecurity, in drawing up the plans. 5G is inextricably a geopolitical issue. Some member states, such as Poland Poland and Romania Romania , have adopted agreements with the US on the collaboration of next-generation mobile technologies, while others have tried to resist the US pressure. In March, NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, US General Curtis Scaparrotti, said the Alliance may cut communications with its German counterparts should the latter decide to collaborate with Huawei in the development of 5G. His comments prompted German Chancellor Angela Merkel to state that \u201cwe will define standards for ourselves,\u201d and the Germans have since put forward measures to bolster their 5G security standards. Towards the end of 2019, we conducted a survey of the state of play in Europe. Read here to find out more and expect 5G to dominate the telecommunications agenda over the following twelve months. /// Data protection Data protection Many in Europe have heralded the recent implementation of the California Consumer Privacy Act California Consumer Privacy Act , which took effect on 1 January, as being indicative of the global reach and influence of the GDPR. The new measures will give residents in the state much more control over how their personal data is protected online, while also placing more responsibility on businesses in their data protection practices. In Brussels, following last year\u2019s failure of EU ministers to agree on new measures to bolster data protection standards as part of the ePrivacy regulation ePrivacy regulation , the EU\u2019s new Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton suggested in December that the Commissioner may present a revised ePrivacy proposal as part of the forthcoming Croatian Presidency of the EU. However, a Commission insider later informed EURACTIV that a complete overhaul of the measures is unlikely to be on the table, and Breton will rather seek to make \u2018clarifications\u2019 to the Croatian Presidency concerning any revisions to the text that could be made. In addition, throughout 2020, the European Data Protection Watchdog is set to publish several recommendations on how to improve data rights. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU will have an impact on how data transfers will take place between the two parties. The Commission says it will begin evaluating the UK\u2019s data protection standards with a view to securing an adequacy agreement \u201cby the end of 2020.\u201d However, the Commission actually cannot commence an evaluation of UK data protection standards until the country has left the EU entirely, because the UK would still be bound by EU law during the transition period, which, under the current agreement runs until the end of 2020. Moreover, even when such an evaluation takes place, there could be serious bumps in the road, especially when taking into account the UK\u2019s previous \u2018questionable\u2019 track record in mass surveillance programs and the fact that the ECHR ruled in September 2018 that the U.K. had breached human rights in its mass surveillance program. In terms of extra-territorial applications that have raised data protection worries, China\u2019s TikTok China\u2019s TikTok video-sharing platform is being subjected to a national security review in the US, and the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office will conclude its own investigation over the next few months. It has increased its lobbying presence in the EU, hiring policy experts in Brussels, London, Dublin, Paris, and Berlin. The company, gearing up for the judicious eye of EU regulators, released its own transparency report on January 1. Facebook Facebook , meanwhile, is set to go ahead in 2020 with plans to end-to-end encrypt communications across its messaging platforms, such as Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp . The move was welcomed by privacy activists but criticised by those in the security world. /// Cybersecurity Cybersecurity As part of the EU\u2019s cybersecurity act, adopted last year, cybersecurity certification schemes may become commonplace for a breath of goods and services \u2013 the scope of which is still to be hashed out by the Commission working alongside ENISA. EURACTIV understands that the priority for the EU is to ensure that hackable goods connected to a wider network of devices are likely to be included in the scope of the certification framework \u2013 including equipment used for 5G infrastructure, as well as Internet of Things devices and cloud services. 2020 may see significant cybersecurity breaches across public and private sectors, with a further blurring of the boundaries between hacktivism, criminality, and terrorism. Expect cyber warfare to very well be increasingly conducted with Artificial Intelligence activities, as well as an increase in the cost of cyber insurance as a result of an increase in threats and attacks.

They are worried about protecting their privacy,\u201d Huawei\u2019s EU head, Abraham Liu, told EURACTIV on the sidelines of his recent appearance at the European Parliament in Brussels. \u201cIndustry must listen to those concerns,\u201d Liu added. The deployment of facial recognition software irks many in Europe. A case in point has been the recent concerns aired by privacy advocates in Serbia, where Huawei has installed a network of security cameras reportedly equipped with facial recognition technology in Belgrade. There are plans to cover around 800 locations throughout the city with around 1,000 cameras. \u201cThe system can be used to trail political opponents, monitor regime critics at any moment, which is completely against the law,\u201d said Serbia\u2019s former commissioner for personal data protection, Rodoljub \u0160abi\u0107. Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 has recently said that police in the city have capacities to count \u201ceach head\u201d at anti-government gatherings, prompting recent anti-government protestors to target the cameras at recent rallies, taping over the lenses and attempting to stop the recordings. In response to the worries, Huawei said that it \u201ccomplies with all applicable laws and regulations\u201d in Serbia. Speaking to EURACTIV, Liu struck a more conscientious tone, saying that there are social and cultural differences even amongst European states with regards to the deployment of facial recognition technologies, and these must be taken into account in the rollout of these technologies. At the EU level, the European Commission is expected to deliver new rules that will give citizens rights over the use of their facial recognition data. This is part of a pledge made by incoming Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to establish a framework for Artificial Intelligence and Ethics within the first 100 days after the new college of commissioners takes office. This move follows a June recommendation from the Commission\u2019s High-Level Group on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics, which stated that consent must be given in the automatic identification of individuals through the use of AI. Liu\u2019s reading of the cultural multifariousness of European perspectives on facial recognition technologies is well-founded: French President Emmanuel Macron is gearing up to release his country\u2019s new ID programme, called \u2018Alicem\u2019 in November, which will employ facial recognition technologies for identity verification purposes. The government is pitching the software as allowing \u201cany individual who decides to use it to prove his identity on the internet in a secure manner,\u201d However, even within France, there have been divisions, with the country\u2019s data regulator, the CNIL, saying the technology breaches consent rules outlined in the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which state that users must give their permission before their biometric data can be stored. Facial recognition in airports Facial recognition in airports Meanwhile, Huawei is continuing to deploy facial recognition technologies more widely, which, for example, could soon be put into practice in Europe as part of the plans to develop \u2018smart airports.\u2019 It transpired earlier this month that the Vaclav Havel Airport in Prague excluded two bids from tenders for hardware supply, worth seven million Czech Korunas, over security issues related to Huawei and ZTE. The airport acted after receiving advice from the Czech National Office for Cyber \u200b\u200band Information Security. The two tenders, launched in September, were for offering CCTV and security services in the airport \u2013 an area where Huawei, in particular, has been attempting to make headway over recent months. The company\u2019s 5G technologies were recently rolled out at the newly opened Beijing Daxing International Airport, now the largest single terminal in the world. The 5G network infrastructure that the company has put into practice at the airport allows for the use of facial recognition technologies for check-in, security clearance and boarding. In such cases, passengers aren\u2019t required to show ID, nor present boarding passes. And this week, Huawei has also been rallying the benefits of facial recognition technologies as part of airport infrastructure, at India\u2019s Mobile Congress. EURACTIV understands that Huawei has been in talks with other airports across Europe about involvement in developing their digital infrastructure. One official speaking at the company\u2019s EcoConnect conference in Shanghai told EURACTIV the company had specifically been speaking with Munich airport recently. With regards to specific airports, however, Liu was unambiguous in saying that each airport should \u201chave its own strategy\u201d on the potential implementation of smart technologies. \u201cWe will always maintain very high ethical standards,\u201d Liu said. \u201cInternationally, we respect all treaties and will always take into account the needs and requirements of our customers all over the world.\u201d \u201cIn terms of facial recognition technologies, people all over the world have different mindsets, and it\u2019s our responsibility to be sensitive to them,\u201d he said.

{"_id": "15299247059_10156823958357060", "content": "Rapid urbanisation and climate change are intertwined, making decarbonisation of the built environment paramount to stabilising the future. The technologies that will deliver significant emissions reductions there will deliver benefits for all those involved, writes Casey Talon. Casey Talon is a research director with Navigant Research, contributing to the Intelligent Building Management solution. Decision-making and investment processes for constructing and operating buildings must be redefined to achieve the deep emissions reductions required to course correct climate change. Electrification is a major focus for decarbonisation\u2014notably replacing gas-powered space and water heating with electric systems\u2014but intelligent building technologies also have a critical role in the low carbon future. In particular, analytics offer insight necessary to monitor and achieve efficiencies in ongoing operations for emissions reductions while delivering the enhanced experience and financial benefits that drive stakeholder commitment. Navigant Research is bullish on the market\u2019s outlook due to the maturing use cases and impacts of key enabling technologies, as outlined in its report, Intelligent Buildings Overview . In Europe, revenues from enabling hardware, software, and services are expected to grow from \u20ac7 billion in 2019 to \u20ac26 billion in 2028. New synergies feed into a competitive building ecosystem New synergies feed into a competitive building ecosystem Intelligent building offerings are key to the energy industry\u2019s transformation for a low carbon future. The relationship between building energy supply and demand is evolving. A more sustainable, highly digitised, and dynamic energy system is emerging. Intelligent building solutions enable engagement in this new ecosystem. Intelligent buildings use data analytics to direct automation and controls to optimise energy consumption, comfort, and experience. These digital, future-ready buildings use technology to coordinate building operations with other onsite distributed energy resources like solar, storage, or EV charging infrastructure. New synergies will emerge between utilities, technology and service providers, and building owners as traditional market roles give way to a more fluid competitive ecosystem.   Significant value creation opportunities will emerge as an increasingly dynamic, flexible, and intelligent building stock achieves seamless interaction with an evolving grid infrastructure that prioritises clean, distributed, mobile, and intelligent market systems. Early examples illustrate the opportunities for intelligent buildings such as the Lighthouse Cities, the GrowSmarter urban laboratories initiative. Projects in Stockholm, Cologne, and Barcelona are showcasing the future intersection of smart buildings, infrastructure, and energy. In a recent article , Gustaf Landahl, project coordinator and Head of Department for Planning and Environment in the Environment and Health Administration at the City of Stockholm, explained, \u201cLooking at buildings for example, the focus is mainly on newly built buildings; but most of the building stock in use is much older. Around one-third of Europeans live in buildings from the 1960s and 1970s, which are all in need of renovation. Under GrowSmarter, buildings from the 1960s have been refurbished to meet newly built energy standards. If we see this potential, we can start putting in solutions to save energy and give people better instruments to control their own use of energy.\u201d Focus on decarbonisation and eye the bottom line Focus on decarbonisation and eye the bottom line The intelligent building technologies market is a competitive, dynamic environment. Small, nimble startups with unique hardware and software solutions can earn a place in an intelligent building solution on their own merit or in partnership with other more established players. Advisory services have moved to the forefront as business relationships have evolved from a technical focus to offerings with deeper strategic business guidance and a roadmap forward. Challenges in the market, such as the integration of diverse systems, are being overcome through persistent innovation of technologies, partnerships that enable complete solutions, and the flexibility of intelligent solutions. Norway offers one example with Powerhouse Bratt\u00f8rkaia . Real estate company Entra, construction and development company Skanska, the nongovernmental organisation ZERO, Sn\u00f8hetta architects, and consultancy Asplan Viak partnered and introduced the high profile energy positive office building. New revenue streams will emerge when the building sells excess clean power generation to neighbouring buildings or the grid. Automation and control and data analytics\u2014key intelligent building solutions\u2014will be the backbone of this future-ready building. The climate crisis demands urgent action. Intelligent building solutions can become the bridge between advocates focused on decarbonisation and executives eyeing the bottom line. The transformation of a commercial facility or housing development into digital, flexible, and low carbon buildings will deliver benefits to all stakeholders.", "source_name": "EURACTIV", "title": "Intelligent building technologies are critical to a low-carbon future"}
{"_id": "15299247059_10157219165732060", "content": "The European Commission is in consultation with EU data protection authorities following the news that US technology firm Clearview AI has scraped more than three billion facial images from social media sites including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, without obtaining the permission of users. It has also transpired following an investigation by Buzzfeed news that the company wants to expand its service to the European market, with nine European countries including Italy, Greece, and the Netherlands as potential partners. Meanwhile, EURACTIV has been informed by a US official that Clearview AI is not a member of the 2016 EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which obliges American companies to protect personal data belonging to EU citizens, according to EU standards and consumer rights. Clearview AI has not as yet disclosed whether any of the images have been harvested from EU citizens. If this were to be the case, the software may violate the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, Article 4 (14) of which covers the processing of biometric data. \u201cThe Commission is aware of the press reports, we are following the dossier and remain in close contact with national data protection authorities and the European Data Protection Board,\u201d a spokesperson from the EU executive told EURACTIV. \u201cThese technologies don\u2019t operate in a legal vacuum. The use of personal data falls under strict GDPR rules requiring well-defined legal basis and legitimate purposes, that the data subject is aware of the process and has means of redress and verification.\u201d The official added that the Commission is currently putting the final touches to its plans for a possible regulatory environment for Artificial Intelligence technologies, and is \u201cconsidering specific requirements for facial recognition.\u201d This comes following a recent leak that revealed that the Commission is considering measures to impose a temporary ban on facial recognition technologies. However, a later leak removed the suggestion that there could be a moratorium on facial recognition technologies in the EU. The finalised paper is set to be presented by the Commission on February 19. In EU member states, meanwhile, plans have been recently announced for the rollout of facial recognition technology on the continent. Germany has revealed plans to roll out automatic facial recognition at 134 railway stations and 14 airports, while France also has the intention to establish a legal framework permitting video surveillance systems to be embedded with facial recognition technologies . For its part, the European Data Protection Board, which the Commission has been consulting following the concerns surrounding Clearview AI, released guidelines on the use of facial recognition technologies in January this year. \u201cThe use of biometric data and in particular facial recognition entails heightened risks for data subjects\u2019 rights,\u201d the paper states. \u201cIt is crucial that recourse to such technologies takes place with due respect to the principles of lawfulness, necessity, proportionality and data minimisation as set forth in the GDPR.\u201d An official from the European Data Protection Board informed EURACTIV that \u201cthe GDPR is designed to be technologically neutral and that the EDPB generally does not adopt guidance concerning specific companies.\u201d The official added, however, that as yet, no questions have been raised to the Board regarding Clearview AI\u2019s software. Clearview AI provides organisations, predominantly law enforcement agencies, with a database that is able to match images of faces with over three billion other facial pictures scraped from social media sites. The company has recently been hit with a series of reprisals from social media platforms, who have taken a hostile stance in response to Clearview AI\u2019s operations. In January, Twitter sent a cease and desist letter and requested the deletion of all collected data Clearview had harvested from its platform. YouTube and Facebook followed up with similar actions in February. Clearview AI claims that they have a First Amendment right to public information, and defends its practice on the basis of assisting law enforcement agencies in the fight against crime. Law enforcement agencies themselves are exempt from the EU\u2019s GDPR. Moreover, Clearview AI may find further comfort in the fact that last year, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that automated scraping doesn\u2019t violate the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a law which had often been cited in the fight against mass data scraping.

{"_id": "15299247059_10157240290302060", "content": "Artificial Intelligence technologies carrying a high-risk of abuse that could potentially lead to an erosion of fundamental rights will be subjected to a series of new requirements, the European Commission announced on Wednesday (19 February). As part of the executive\u2019s White paper on AI, a series of \u2018high-risk\u2019 technologies have been earmarked for future oversight, including those in \u2018critical sectors\u2019 and those deemed to be of \u2018critical use.\u2019 Those under the critical sectors remit include healthcare, transport, police, recruitment, and the legal system, while technologies of critical use include such technologies with a risk of death, damage or injury, or with legal ramifications. Artificial Intelligence technologies coming under those two categories will be obliged to abide by strict rules, which could include compliance tests and controls, the Commission said on Wednesday. Sanctions could be imposed should certain technologies fail to meet such requirements. Such \u2018high-risk\u2019 technologies should also come \u201cunder human control,\u201d according to Commission documents. Areas that are deemed to not be of high-risk, an option could be to introduce a voluntary labelling scheme, which would highlight the trustworthiness of an AI product by merit of the fact that it meets \u201ccertain objective and standardised EU-wide benchmarks.\u201d However, the Commission stopped short of identifying technology manufactured from outside the EU in certain authoritarian regimes as necessarily \u2018high risk.\u2019 Pressed on this point by EURACTIV on Wednesday, Thierry Breton, the Commissioner for the Internal Market, said manufacturers could be forced to \u201cretrain algorithms locally in Europe with European data.\u201d \u201cWe could be ready to do this if we believe it is appropriate for our needs and our security,\u201d Breton added. Another area in which the Commission will seek to provide greater oversight is the use of potentially biased data sets that may negatively impact demographic minorities. In this field, the executive has outlined plans to ensure that unbiased data sets are used in Artificial Intelligence technologies, avoiding discrimination of under-represented populations in algorithmic processes. More generally, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised Europe\u2019s efforts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thus far, saying that such technologies can be of vital use in a number of sectors including in healthcare, agriculture and energy, and can also help Europe to meet sustainable goals. Conformity Assessment Conformity Assessment However, she also noted the importance of ensuring that certain AI technologies meet certain standards in order to be of use to European citizens. \u201cHigh-risk AI technologies must be tested and certified before they reach the market,\u201d von der Leyen said. Along this axis, the Commission will establish an \u2018objective, prior conformity assessment\u2019 in order to ensure that AI systems are technically robust, accurate and trustworthy. \u201cSuch systems need to be developed in a responsible manner and with an ex-ante due and proper consideration of the risks that they may generate. Their development and functioning must be such to ensure that AI systems behave reliably as intended,\u201d stated the White Paper , which is open for public consultation until 19 May. Such a conformity assessment could include procedures for testing, inspection and certification. Importantly, the Commission also states that such an assessment \u201ccould include checks of the algorithms and of the data sets used in the development phase.\u201d The EU\u2019s Vice-President for Digital, Margrethe Vestager, said on Wednesday that an assessment will be made in the future as to whether this approach is effective or not. Facial Recognition Facial Recognition Elsewhere in the Artificial Intelligence White Paper, the Commission held back on introducing strict measures against facial recognition technologies. A leaked version of the document had previously floated the idea of putting forward a moratorium on facial recognition software. However, the executive now plans to \u201claunch an EU-wide debate on the use of remote biometric identification,\u201d of which facial recognition technologies are a part. On Wednesday, Vestager noted that facial recognition technologies \u201cin some cases are harmless\u201d but a wider consultation is required to identify the extent to which remote biometric identification as part of AI technologies should be permitted. The Commission also highlighted the fact that under current EU data protection rules, the processing of biometric data for the cause of identifying individuals is prohibited, unless specific conditions with regards to national security or public interest are met. Article 6 of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation outlines the conditions under which personal data can be legally processed, one such requirement being that the data subject has given their explicit consent. Article 4 (14) of the legislation covers the processing of biometric data. In recent months, EU member states have been charting future plans in the field of facial recognition technologies. Germany wishes to roll out automatic facial recognition at 134 railway stations and 14 airports. France also has plans to establish a legal framework permitting video surveillance systems to be embedded with facial recognition technologies . Rights groups have called for more stringent measures to be enacted in the future against facial recognition technologies, in response to the Commission\u2019s announcement on Wednesday. \u201cIt is of utmost importance and urgency that the EU prevents the deployment of mass surveillance and identification technologies without fully understanding their impact on people and their rights, and without ensuring that these systems are fully compliant with data protection and privacy law as well as all other fundamental rights,\u201d said Diego Naranjo, head of policy at European Digital Rights (EDRi).

EURACTIV Germany took the chance to head along and sit down with Francesca Bria to discuss Spain\u2019s role in the EU\u2019s digital revolution. Francesca Bria is Barcelona\u2019s Chief Technology and Digital Innovation Officer. She spoke to EURACTIV Germany\u2019s Alicia Prager. EURACTIV: Can you tell us about your approach to developing Barcelona as a \u201cSmart City\u201d? What are your experiences with shaping its digital strategy? EURACTIV: Can you tell us about your approach to developing Barcelona as a \u201cSmart City\u201d? What are your experiences with shaping its digital strategy? Bria: Bria: At first, our problem was that the concept of the \u201cSmart City\u201d has been developed by the big tech vendors for the last ten years. They introduced all kinds of different technologies: connectivity, big data, big dashboards in order to manage the city service. But why do we need this technology? Who is going to govern this data? Who is going to own the infrastructure of the city? So we shifted the paradigm upside down and started with the problems that citizens are facing in the city: affordable housing, the energy transition, climate change. And then we discussed how to give back the control of data to citizens. We started a large-scale participatory democracy movement, both online and offline. We went from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, doing citizens participation processes to identify their priorities and then used the online platform \u201cDecidim Barcelona\u201d with 400.000 citizens to prioritize their proposals and create the Government Agenda. What is the key motivation for your work in Barcelona? What impacts are you hoping for? What is the key motivation for your work in Barcelona? What impacts are you hoping for? For us, one of the main problems is the crisis of political representation: people don\u2019t trust public institutions anymore. They don\u2019t think we have a vision for the future, they don\u2019t think that we are solving their problems. And also they don\u2019t trust the corporations anymore. And this is why we have so many people voting for populist, right-wing parties that are raising to power all around the world. So, we wanted to rethink the relationship between citizens and public institutions and try to revitalize democracy, putting people at the centre. Our answer to right-wing populism is not less democracy \u2013 it\u2019s more democracy. How are you putting that into action? How are you putting that into action? For example, we own 700 km2 of fibre and have built a sensor and an IoT (Internet of things) network. This means we can store the data in a public repository. Using privacy, security and ethics by design and then use this data to help solve the real problems of the citizens. Citizens can choose whom to share their data with: for example, they can grant the doctors access to their medical data in order to improve the health system, but at the same time making sure that insurance companies won\u2019t get access to that information. The idea is to give back data sovereignty to citizens. Could the model be replicated in other cities? Could the model be replicated in other cities? Yes, we refer to all the technology policies that we run in Barcelona as \u201c ethical digital standards \u201d and we share them with hundreds of cities around the world using a free software platform . Our digital democracy platform is now being used by over 60 cities around the world and I chair a network of cities called the Cities CIOs Council. There are hundreds of cities who are collaborating in this kind of approaches. Do you feel that less tech-savvy citizens are also involved in these types of developments? Are they clued up to what is going on? Has there been any criticism? For me, it is very important to make these issues around digitalization more political. It\u2019s not about technology, its about the model of the city. Who owns the data and what is done with it, are becoming increasingly political questions now. It\u2019s not just about privacy, it\u2019s also about the economic and social model. In Barcelona we have created the Sharing Cities Alliance , to collectively negotiate with Uber and Airbnb, following the public pressure they have faced: Uber in terms of workers rights and unfair competition with the cab sector, Airbnb for contributing to the rising cost of housing rentals. Cities get out of control. Our project is about reconquering them. One way to gain control over services like Uber and Airbnb could be the introduction of a digital tax. But it sounds like this measure would not go far enough? One way to gain control over services like Uber and Airbnb could be the introduction of a digital tax. But it sounds like this measure would not go far enough? We should tax these companies. Full stop. Then we can also look at ways we should modernise the international tax system to account for the digitalisation of the economy as it is now happening at the OECD level. In Europe we have to build our own way for the digital society, we should not rely on Silicon Valley. We can regulate the big tech platforms, enforce taxation and modernise our competition law but at the same time we need to have our own public infrastructures and we need alternatives. It is a matter of European sovereignty and democracy. How can that be done in times when people use all these platforms so heavily? How can that be done in times when people use all these platforms so heavily? We are using Facebook, Google and so on because we don\u2019t have alternatives. We don\u2019t control our digital identities, we don\u2019t control the data, we don\u2019t control the payment systems. Instead of cleaning the mess up afterwards and trying to fix problems of privacy, monopoly power and our poor infrastructures, we have to take these building blocks of the new digital infrastructure back into public hands and get the all ecosystem to work with us. With the European elections coming up, do you have a message for the new Commission? With the European elections coming up, do you have a message for the new Commission? Get your act together! We need a strategy and we need to act. We should understand that digital is not just about technical tools or some regulatory framework, it\u2019s a core political programme for a future Europe that we have to build. This plan should not be about one particular industry, this has a global impact on society. We need structural transformation, including things like the reallocation of property rights, new welfare programs, new education programs making European universities attractive, and having incentives for talented people working in the tech sector to stay in Europe. Slowly, I feel like politicians are waking up, confronted with geopolitical changes. We should be able to mobilize collective action to make sure Europe will work for a people-centred, rights-preserving vision for the digital society.

An EU Council report, reportedly circulated among 10 member states last November, details measures led by Austria to legislate for the building of a network of facial recognition databases that could be used and accessed by police forces across the bloc. The documents, obtained by The Intercept, correspond to a series of reports which examine whether the Pr\u00fcm treaty, which contains rules for operational police cooperation between EU member states, should be expanded to include facial images. Under the current regime, there are provisions in place that permit the sharing of DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration databases between participating member states. The initiative had been originally put forward by German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble in 2005. The expansion of the Pr\u00fcm treaty to cover facial recognition images was foreseen following Council conclusions in 2018, which invited member state experts as part of the Council\u2019s Working Party on Information Exchange and Data Protection \u201cto evaluate the Pr\u00fcm workflow for further developments with a view to possible new biometric technologies, e.g. face recognition systems.\u201d Reports suggest that in order to judge the feasibility of incorporating facial recognition technologies into the Pr\u00fcm agreement, the European Commission has contracted international consultancy Deloitte to conduct an assessment, to the sum of \u20ac700,000. Artificial Intelligence White Paper Artificial Intelligence White Paper The leaked documents come at a time when the EU is wrestling with the question of whether facial recognition technologies should be regulated in the bloc or not. Earlier this year, documents obtained by EURACTIV suggested that the European Commission had been mulling over a possible five-year moratorium on the technology as part of its White Paper on Artificial Intelligence \u2013 its roadmap for how the executive would look to mitigate future risks in the field. However, these plans were shelved in the final version of the White Paper published last week, with the Commission instead opting for an \u201cEU-wide debate on the use of remote biometric identification.\u201d The Commission had also highlighted the fact that under current EU data protection rules, the processing of biometric data for the cause of identifying individuals is prohibited, unless specific conditions with regards to national security or public interest are met. Article 6 of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation outlines the conditions under which personal data can be legally processed, one such requirement being that the data subject has given their explicit consent. Article 4 (14) of the legislation covers the processing of biometric data. Despite this, in recent months, EU member states have been charting future plans in the field of facial recognition technologies. Germany has outlined intentions to roll out automatic facial recognition at 134 railway stations and 14 airports, while France also has plans to establish a legal framework permitting video surveillance systems to be embedded with facial recognition technologies . More broadly, the EU\u2019s AI White paper highlighted a series of \u2018high-risk\u2019 technologies which could be in store for future oversight. Such technologies fall into two categories: those in \u2018critical sectors\u2019 and those deemed to be of \u2018critical use.\u2019 Those under the critical sectors remit include healthcare, transport, police, recruitment, and the legal system, while technologies of critical use include such technologies with a risk of death, damage or injury, or with legal ramifications. Clearview AI Clearview AI Elsewhere, the EU has taken a robust stance on the application of facial recognition elsewhere in the world. Following the recent news that US technology firm Clearview AI has scraped more than three billion facial images from social media sites including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, without obtaining users\u2019 permission, the Commission had been in consultation with EU data protection authorities over whether the data of European citizens could have been at risk. Clearview AI provides law enforcement agencies with a database that is able to match images of faces with over three billion other facial pictures scraped from social media sites. \u201cThe Commission is aware of the press reports, we are following the dossier and remain in close contact with national data protection authorities and the European Data Protection Board,\u201d a spokesperson from the EU executive told EURACTIV. \u201cThese technologies don\u2019t operate in a legal vacuum. The use of personal data falls under strict GDPR rules requiring well-defined legal basis and legitimate purposes, that the data subject is aware of the process and has means of redress and verification.\u201d Clearview AI is not a member of the 2016 EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which obliges American companies to protect personal data belonging to EU citizens, according to EU standards and consumer rights.

The news comes as US authorities renew their campaign in Europe against the Chinese telecoms giant. The agency, which reports to the Belgian prime minister, had been tasked with analyzing the possible threat posed by Huawei, which supplies equipment to Belgian mobile operators Proximus, Orange Belgium and Telenet. \u201cUntil now we have not found technical indications that point in the direction of a spying threat,\u201d a spokesman for the agency said on Monday. \u201cWe are not providing a final report on the matter, but are continuing to look into it.\u201d Meanwhile, the United States will push its allies at a meeting in Prague next month to adopt shared security and policy measures that will make it more difficult for China\u2019s Huawei to dominate 5G telecommunications networks, according to people familiar with the matter and documents seen by Reuters. The event and broader U.S. campaign to limit the role of Chinese telecommunications firms in the build out of 5G networks comes as Western governments grapple with the national security implications of moving to 5G, which promises to be at least 100 times faster than the current 4G networks. The issue is crucial because of 5G\u2019s leading role in internet-connected products ranging from self-driving cars and smart cities to augmented reality and artificial intelligence. If the underlying technology for 5G connectivity is vulnerable then it could allow hackers to exploit such products to spy or disrupt them. The United States has been meeting with allies in recent months to warn them Washington believes Huawei\u2019s equipment could be used by the Chinese state to spy. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has repeatedly denied the allegations. Officials from more than 30 countries will meet May 2-3 to agree on security principles for next-generation telecoms networks, said Robert Kahofer, chief of cabinet at Czech cybersecurity agency NUKIB. A U.S. official familiar with the plan said the Prague meeting marks a strategic shift in how the U.S. government plans to urge allies to drop Huawei and other 5G vendors in the future, which Washington believes pose a risk to national security. The official described the approach as \u201csofter.\u201d A Huawei spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. proposals for the Prague meeting urge governments and operators to consider the legal environment in a vendor\u2019s country, how much state support a company receives, transparency of corporate structure, and trustworthiness of equipment. It also calls on partners to prioritize security and work together on investigations into cyberattacks aimed at 5G architecture. The documents do not mention Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecoms equipment maker, by name, but U.S. officials said they hoped it would provide the \u201cintellectual framework\u201d needed for other countries to effectively bar Chinese vendors. In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using Huawei and ZTE Corp equipment. \u201cThe goal is to agree upon a set of shared principles that would ensure the security of next-generation telecommunications networks,\u201d said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The Prague conference has been organized by the Czech foreign ministry with support from NUKIB, said Kahofer. The foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Delegations from all of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states, as well as the European Commission, NATO and around eight other countries including the United States and Australia are expected to attend, Kahofer said. China and Russia have not been invited, he added, but stressed that the event was not \u201can anti-Huawei or anti-China conference.\u201d Europe has emerged as a key battleground for the future of 5G, with the United States pushing allies and partners to bar Chinese vendors but European governments wary of the trade and economic consequences of angering Beijing. Internet service providers have also warned that banning Huawei would incur huge costs and delay the rollout of 5G by years. A senior U.S. cybersecurity official said last week Washington wanted European governments to adopt \u201crisk-based security frameworks\u201d, citing recent moves in Germany to implement stricter security standards for all 5G vendors, and that doing so would effectively rule out using Huawei and ZTE. \u201cThe United States welcomes engagement from partners and allies to discuss ways that we can work together ensuring that our 5G networks are reliable and secure,\u201d said White House National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis. Officials in Britain, which last month exposed new security flaws in Huawei equipment but says it has found no evidence of Chinese state interference, have also spoken of \u201craising security across the board\u201d for 5G. The European Commission said in March that EU nations would be required to share data on 5G cybersecurity risks and produce measures to tackle them by the end of the year.", "source_name": "EURACTIV", "title": "Belgian cybersecurity agency finds no threat from Huawei, as US increase pressure"}

EURACTIV talked to Greek MEP Eva Kaili about how she hopes the EU\u2019s digital agenda over the next five years will play out. Eva Kaili is a Greek MEP for the Socialists and Democrats group. Ahead of her keynote address at the upcoming EIT Digital Conference , she responded to questions from EURACTIV\u2019s Digital Editor Samuel Stolton . Let\u2019s start with one of the more contentious issues of the next mandate. What\u2019s your take on ethics in the field of Artificial Intelligence? Would you welcome regulation in Artificial Intelligence to help preserve EU principles? What are the challenges of this? Let\u2019s start with one of the more contentious issues of the next mandate. What\u2019s your take on ethics in the field of Artificial Intelligence? Would you welcome regulation in Artificial Intelligence to help preserve EU principles? What are the challenges of this? I think the ethical aspect of AI should be a primary concern. Already in the European Parliament report on AI which I shadowed on behalf of the S&D group, we focused a lot on the ethics of AI development. On many paragraphs, we emphasized on \u201cethics by design\u201d approach and on the fact that companies producing AI must be very cautious on incorporating any kind of bias on the AI systems. We also warned against any malicious use of AI from companies who might use face recognition or mood detecting AI technologies in order to manipulate your emotions, feelings and try to gain profit from them by selling you relevant products. Another issue that will be very important is sensitive personal data. We have to ensure that under no circumstances any AI system will be able to disclose any sensitive private data it might collect. The right to privacy will be one of the most pressing issues in the years to come in my opinion and AI will have to be adjustable to this. How concerned are you with the use of AI across totalitarian regimes worldwide? How concerned are you with the use of AI across totalitarian regimes worldwide? Very. But even more worrying is what those regimes will be able to do to their citizens by deploying advanced AI surveillance systems. Will it be then that we will see a pure Orwellian universe where the state will be able to control even the emotions of its people? Another concern is weaponised AI. Let\u2019s just imagine how much destruction they will be able to cause. My intention is not to set the scene of a bleak future but to affirm that we will need international cooperation and specific standards exactly the same way we have treaties for chemical and biological weapons. You recently submitted a question to the European Commission in which you highlight potential challenges with regards to GDPR hindering AI development. Could you say a bit more about this? You recently submitted a question to the European Commission in which you highlight potential challenges with regards to GDPR hindering AI development. Could you say a bit more about this? The GDPR is a landmark legislation which established a framework that safeguards our data from being processed without our consent \u2013 giving us back our privacy and control over personal information ownership. Although a great achievement, the GDPR includes provisions which could potentially hinder the development of data-driven, self-learning algorithmic systems. For example, if Article 22 of the GDPR is applied to AI tools, automated decision-making systems would be faced with regulatory backstops aimed at safeguarding the rights of data subjects. AI development is a cornerstone of the EU\u2019s future strategy. It is important to create a space for it, in which it can be developed \u2013 and its development relies on the availability of datasets. It is therefore important to combine the lessons learned from GDPR in the AI space, without over-regulating it so that innovation can be incubated rather than halted. G7 ministers recently put forward a series of requirements for Facebook\u2019s new coin \u2018Libra\u2019 to abide by. Do you agree that there are \u2018serious risks\u2019 surrounding Libra? What could these be and how could these be met at an EU level? G7 ministers recently put forward a series of requirements for Facebook\u2019s new coin \u2018Libra\u2019 to abide by. Do you agree that there are \u2018serious risks\u2019 surrounding Libra? What could these be and how could these be met at an EU level? Libra is just one more example of a corporation that tries to leverage the tokenization of value in its business model. Many firms have done it already and thousands will follow soon. This is a natural evolution of the economy and we cannot stop the democratization of money. I introduced those concepts two years ago in the DLTs and Blockchain Resolution. Unfortunately, ECB, EBA and ESMA ignored my recommendations, they adopted a rather defensive view on crypto assets and they systematically try to keep under the carpet a wave of disruption. Well, the risks are there, but the potential is immense as well. I believe that we need a holistic view about the tokenization of the economy, to tame the related risk by making a crypto assets integral part of the mainstream regulated economy, and re-assess the idea of monetary policy and central banking by figuring out their relevance in an economy where IoT and AI play a dominant role. You\u2019ve previously been heavily involved in tax issues. What is your opinion on the taxation of digital giants? Do you agree that there is a risk of the EU market fracturing if a common EU approach isn\u2019t found on digital services tax? Or would you prefer a broader international agreement? You\u2019ve previously been heavily involved in tax issues. What is your opinion on the taxation of digital giants? Do you agree that there is a risk of the EU market fracturing if a common EU approach isn\u2019t found on digital services tax? Or would you prefer a broader international agreement? Digital tax is a sine qua non in the current economic reality. The idea behind it, though, should be rather positive than negative. In my view, digital tax is a tool for reduction of the digital inequality within the economy and the creation of competitive advantage between the economies. Also, it is a tool for bridging the digital gap within the society and the business field with critical investments in digital infrastructure, digital innovation and what I call \u201chuman digital capital\u201d through education. Digital Tax should not be a burden but a factor of acceleration of the competitive position of the EU economy as well as a factor of accelerating the transition to Industry 4.0. For this reason, I suggest an EU Digital Transition Fund where proceedings of the Digital Tax will be accumulated and then channelled in digital transition projects. Allow me to predict that the current proposition will never be adopted. Digital Tax is a necessary growth instrument that requires us to be ambitious, technologically savvy, and competition relevant. A good European Digital Tax will provide EU with a significant regulatory advantage over our global competitors and we should not miss the opportunity. It has recently been revealed that the EU is preparing a broad-ranging \u2018Digital Services Act,\u2019 that would allow the bloc to regulate against illegal material online, giving clearer rules for platform liability.

It has recently been revealed that the EU is preparing a broad-ranging \u2018Digital Services Act,\u2019 that would allow the bloc to regulate against illegal material online, giving clearer rules for platform liability. Do you think regulation of this nature is necessary? What will the challenges be of adopting such an act? The framework governing online content in the EU is highly fragmented. Whether addressing services like social media or activity areas like online advertising, the laws within the EU remain divergent. It is necessary for the EU to harmonise the governance of online content and address risks like online hate speech, discrimination, or disinformation. The expected Commission proposal for a Digital Services Act should be aimed at harmonising the divergent rules for online services in the Digital Single Market. Moreover, the proposal should be aimed at incentivising large companies to tackle harmful online content beyond the voluntary self-regulating framework under which they operate now. Lastly, the Commission proposal should emphasise the need for stronger public oversight and mechanisms to address content moderation systems. A harmonised framework addressing the needs of the modern and evolving landscape of online services will also benefit innovators as barriers to access the European market will diminish.

Member states have recently submitted their risk assessment reports for the future of Europe\u2019s 5G network. What do you think are the most pressing issues when thinking about the future of Europe\u2019s 5G infrastructure? What are the challenges and solutions? 5G networks will be the cornerstone of the European economy and society in the future. In 2025, worldwide 5G revenues are expected to amount to \u20ac225 billion. 5G networks will seamlessly connect billions of devices, and enable the transmission of massive amounts of data between and among connected devices. The most pressing issues in deploying 5G networks at scale within the EU relate to ensuring the stability and security of those networks from potential harms. 5G networks not only enable steadier and faster connection for our devices but also connect critical infrastructure with central administration. The connection of critical services in key areas like health, finance, transportation, and resource management through 5G networks will also increase the vulnerability of those core functions to potential threats and cyber-attacks. It is imperative for the EU to concentrate its efforts in completing a coordinated European risk assessment on 5G networks. Through the EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA), the EU should complete the threat landscape and the Union-wide exposures to risk related to infrastructure extending to the entire digital ecosystem. Moreover, the Commission working alongside with ENISA and member states should develop minimum common requirements to ensure higher network security.

What are your priorities going into the next mandate with the Science and Technology Options Assessment body, which you chair? As the chair, what I can envisage is that STOA will focus a lot on green technologies and how we can use them to control environmental damage.

We will also focus on issues such as the AI development, how to use technology for humanitarian aid and assistance, bioethics and gene editing and all the technologies that will impact our future. We will also work against fake news through our STOA creation: the European Science Media Hub (ESMH).

With young people leaving in their droves in countries like Croatia and my own, Slovenia, this can lead to a lack of confidence in the future strength of the economy as well as potentially opening the door to radicalisation,\u201d Bogovi\u010d said. One European country that has really suffered from rural depopulation is Serbia. Regardless of the fact that Serbia is not in the EU, the trend of young people leaving rural areas in order to move to more modernised economies in Europe\u2019s northwest is indicative of the trend happening across the bloc, Bogovi\u010d believes. A September analysis conducted by Professor Sasa Randjelovic from the Belgrade Faculty of Economics, based on IMF figures, predicted that the country\u2019s population could decline by up to a million by 2050, and the country\u2019s labour force could fall by around 900,000. A way of encouraging people to remain in their countries of origin inside the EU, Bogovi\u010d believes, is to make sure that citizens all across Europe have access to the same high-tech infrastructure that is on offer in more developed northern European states. Bogovi\u010d believes that communities in less-developed parts of Europe should be able to benefit from the enhancement of logistical and communicative networks by way of the application of digital technologies, in what is dubbed \u2018smart villages\u2019. Currently, the Smart Village initiative is financially supported by several EU funding frameworks, including provisions laid out in the Rural development policy (EAFRD) within the Common Agricultural Policy, EU cohesion funds, Horizon 2020, and the Connecting Europe Facility. Broadband coverage Broadband coverage One area of importance which should not be overlooked in the future digital transformation of rural communities, Bogovi\u010d believes, is ensuring that the patchy nature of Europe\u2019s broadband coverage is drastically improved. As part of its Europe 2020 strategy, in 2010, the EU set out a series of broadband targets, including the objective of providing by 2020 all Europeans with a broadband connection of over 30Mbps. However, towards the end of last year, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) intervened in the pursuance of these objectives, citing the difficulties of rolling out fast broadband coverage across remote areas of the Union. \u201cRural areas,\u201d the ECA report wrote, \u201cwhere there is less incentive for the private sector to invest in broadband provision, remain less well connected than cities, and take-up of ultra-fast broadband is significantly behind target.\u201d \u201cThe most important thing is to cover these areas with quality broadband, and then prepare business models which use this technology in different sectors,\u201d Bogovi\u010d said, adding that agriculture precision farming would be one specific sector which rural communities could benefit from, given a wide disparity in coverage rates between metropolitan and rural areas of Europe. Figures from the European Network for Rural Development state that, on average, connectivity in rural areas is approximately half (47%) of that across the rest of the EU. Precision farming Precision farming Precision farming uses information technology systems such as GPS, drones, sensors and autonomous vehicles, among other technologies, to optimise and automatise agricultural processes. Broadband coverage is required for these networked technologies to function properly, and many also believe that 5G connectivity is necessary to make the most out of precision agriculture. A 2016 scientific study conducted by the European Parliament\u2019s Research Service found that \u201cEU support would be most needed in the coming decade for the building of 5G infrastructure for European farmers.\u201d However, due to lower population densities of communities in rural areas, telecommunications firms are reluctant to invest heavily without the support of EU structural funds. The report goes on to state that there is a \u201cclear case\u201d for public financial backing, and that 5G coverage could be \u2018crucial\u2019 for the development of next-generation agricultural technologies. \u201cEU agriculture needs better performing broadband service, coverage and latency,\u201d the report concludes. \u201c5G technology could also greatly contribute to improving the positioning accuracy and farms\u2019 connectivity. It is a key enabler of a performing and sustainable agriculture.\u201d However, for the technology alone to achieve its potential, Bogovi\u010d believes that bridging Europe\u2019s digital skills gap must also be taken into account when investing heavily in next-generation technologies. A Commission declaration earlier this year, presented to the EU\u2019s Special Committee on Agriculture, an offshoot of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, found that the \u201clack of a digitally skilled workforce is also slowing down the modernisation\u201d of the farming sector. It said that there is a knowledge gap in the usefulness of existing technologies in agriculture as well as a deficiency in digital skills in the farming world. For Bogovi\u010d, the fact that Europe lacks young farmers may negatively impact the uptake of digital skills, EU figures show that only one in ten EU farm managers (11 %) were under the age of 40 in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we work more with young farmers, that we find out more about certain individuals who could be ambassadors of next-generation farming,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need people who are willing to take the traditions of the past and take them into the smart villages of the 21 st century.\u201d [Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]", "source_name": "EURACTIV", "title": "\u2018Smart villages\u2019 could slow problem of rural depopulation, MEP says"}

Comparisons are being drawn with the role of gold and oil in powering previous revolutions. However, unlike the commodities that transformed industries in the past, data is ubiquitous, easier to extract and reproduce in higher volumes.

Data points are being generated even as this article is being typed and when read by you. Connected devices, quantum computing and AI technologies will expand human frontiers.

It is imperative that data concentration is accounted for as Europe attempts to strike a balance between protectionism and open innovation. This is a notion that European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager recently agreed to, when I asked during her hearing at the European Parliament. A form of digital tax could be a solution for addressing challenges of data concentration. It can also offer a new source of revenue, which Europe can redirect to building internal capacity and the digital skills of Europeans. Big data is unstructured and immensely varied. Yet it is also a valuable source of insight, which could be used to solve problems - big problems, even those yet to be conceived. The challenge lies ahead to determine the value and the truth of big data. It must be aligned with our goals, principles and fundamental rights. Legal certainty is a cornerstone of the data economy in Europe. Public trust in new technologies and data processing must be secured by the strong enforcement of existing EU data protection law. Our rights to equality, and non-discrimination are becoming increasingly more relevant in the context of big data. Immense volumes of unstructured data sets are used to create algorithms and train fuel-reinforced learning AI. Decisions, as well as the decision-making processes, must be transparent and explainable to the user, given the logic involved in automated decision-making and pro\ufb01ling. Pseudonymisation, anonymisation and encryption can reduce risks to privacy and discrimination. It is, however, equally important to ensure that these processes remain irreversible and that safeguards are established to avoid the risk of triangulation, a process through which data correlations can identify an individual. Big data may result not only in infringements of fundamental rights of individuals but also in differential treatment or indirect discrimination against groups of people with similar characteristics. We must be proactive in ensuring fairness and equality of access and opportunity for all. Regulators at the EU level, working with national data protection authorities as well as private sector stakeholders and civil society should articulate common guidelines for data-as-input for algorithms and AI systems. This can become a step in developing a common framework for \u201cclean data\u201d, in order to prevent systems from reproducing biases and discrimination at scale and without consent. Security is critical as we attempt to safeguard our individual rights in the world of big data and intelligent machines. Risks associated with data processing may include breaches, unauthorised access or unlawful surveillance. Here, robust security certi\ufb01cation schemes, cybersecurity frameworks and software liability regimes will complement the eff orts of law enforcement authorities, ultimately creating a safer and fairer space for users to interact with their digital environment. In the near future, big data will fuel intelligent machines and digitalised intelligence. We must ensure that the data used to train algorithms - which can lead to automated decisions by both software and hardware - are of the highest quality, and that data processing by intelligent systems is compliant with our data protection and privacy laws. In these exciting times - when humans and machines construct a symbiotic relationship - data will be the central component of transformation. Our mission, as representatives of European citizens, is to deliver the best possible digital future without leaving anyone behind. We must follow a mission-driven approach to ensure that the digital transformation of Europe is humancentric, not replicating the US and Chinese approaches, which emphasise rapid development and data concentration without robust data protection and privacy frameworks. The European Parliament and the European Commission are working on legislation that will protect our fundamental rights in the digital era. The success of our efforts to protect citizens while reaping the full bene\ufb01ts of this new wave of innovation relies on constructing a European ethical identity of critical regulation in areas like arti\ufb01cial intelligence. We must ensure that technologies like AI are safe, used for good and that the ethical and social challenges they pose are thoroughly addressed through comprehensive industrial AI and data policies and regulations.", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Big data: Safeguarding our fundamental rights"}

This is because they have brought all the disruptive power of digital technology into the pockets of all citizens, opening the door to a range of applications that are fundamentally changing our society and our economy. However, all these innovations have hit a limit created by the capacity of mobile devices to connect to the internet with sufficient bandwidth, reliability and minimal latency. The introduction of the \ufb01fth generation of mobile connection, 5G, now promises to overcome the current limitations of existing mobile devices. More importantly, 5G could enable a new wave of technologies and applications, based on its novel infrastructure for smart cities, advanced manufacturing, healthcare systems and connected cars. This is why every country in the world is investing in accelerating this change. The USA, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan are competing with EU to be the \ufb01rst to develop a fully-functioning 5G network and reap the potential bene\ufb01ts for the economy. The European Union\u2019s connectivity goals for 2025 - including 5G coverage in all urban areas - is set out in its Communication on Connectivity for a Competitive Digital Single Market - Towards a European Gigabit Society. It foresees a budget estimated at \u20ac500 billion. However, the introduction of 5G is a more complicated issue than a simple international race of investments and deployment. There are doubts over the safety of the new wireless connections, which are slowing down the deployment of the new 5G infrastructure. This is why work on 5G infrastructure in the city of Brussels has stopped. Moreover, public and private actors are reluctant to invest large sums in a technology where the business model that will transform those investments into pro\ufb01ts remains nebulous. These are urgent issues that have to be addressed at European level. This is why I recently forwarded a written question to the European Commission on the assessment of the impact of 5G in real world conditions. A study recently presented to the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy noted that the impact of 5G technology and radiation in real world conditions is still to be properly assessed; indeed, it is not yet possible to do this accurately. In addition, some 200 scientists recently launched an appeal, which stated that: \u201c5G technology will signi\ufb01cantly increase exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic \ufb01elds (RF-EMF), in addition to the 2G, 3G, 4G and WiFi telecommunications technologies already in operation\u201d. This is why I asked the European Commission to state whether the opinions drawn up by the Scienti\ufb01c Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) on this subject had assessed the impact of 5G on human health, and particularly children\u2019s health, in real world conditions and situations, rather than simply in lab conditions. Furthermore, I asked it to indicate what assessments have been conducted to pinpoint the strategic sectors where this technology could provide the best applications and those most useful to the European economy. Large-scale investments need strong certainties. Although lower frequencies, many in the UHF range, are being proposed for the \ufb01rst phase of 5G networks, much higher radio frequencies are also projected in bands that are traditionally used for radar and microwave links. Moreover, a radio signal\u2019s effective range reduces in proportion to the square of the frequency. This has major implications for the capital cost of the cellular radio network. Although many of the 5G networks currently being piloted will use the much lower bands, those proposed upper frequencies for the future may only offer propagation ranges in order perhaps as low as tens of metres. Higher frequency signals are also subject to more weather interference - rain, snow, fog \u2013 as well as obstacles such as wet foliage or buildings. This means that, at higher frequencies, indoor use may be problematic if based on through-wall or window penetration. With higher frequencies and shortened ranges, base stations will be more closely packed into a given area to avoid \u201cnot-spots\u201d. Ranges of 20-150 metres may be typical, giving smaller coverage areas per \u201csmall cell\u201d. A cell radius of 20 metres would imply about 800 base stations per square kilometre. This dense network rollout will be costly, not just in terms of installations but also in the costs and delays in obtaining planning permission and authorisation. Therefore, for urban coverage with 5G small cells, it makes sense for member states to simplify and harmonise their authorisation permits and planning permission processes. We have to address these issues and the signi\ufb01cant questions emerging over the possible impact on health and safety arising from potentially higher exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation arising from 5G.", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Crystallising the potential of 5G"}

The aim is to incorporate AI into every facet of life from the economy to government, making business more productive and public service more efficient. Part of this strategy was the creation of a ministerial portfolio dedicated exclusively to AI, with UAE being the first country in the world to do so. Since then, around 30 start-up companies have established themselves in Dubai, a sign that the government\u2019s strategy has succeeded in helping to cultivate and encourage private sector growth in this field. RELATED CONTENT Among them is Derq, an innovative start-up that won funding to develop ways to make the UAE\u2019s cars and roads smarter and safer. The aim is to develop a 24/7 real-time view of the road system and use AI to predict accident blackspots and eliminate crashes. The UAE is on course to be the leading AI hub in the Middle East by 2030. A recent PwC report predicted that AI will be worth $320bn in the Middle East by 2030; in the UAE, AI is expected to make up 13.6 percent of GDP, followed by Saudi Arabia with 12.5 percent. For a region traditionally dependent on oil revenues, these forecasts are a welcome sign that the technology could play a substantial role in diversifying its economy. However, these developments are also raise the broader challenge that AI poses to governments. A recent McKinsey Global report found that half of all current jobs globally can be automated with AI. The development of AI is set to have profound implications for the world of work, which makes institutions such as MBZUAI essential to developing tools and conducting the research needed for us to harness the technology most effectively. AI will create opportunities in the form of new jobs, while also threatening many others. To prepare for this, workers may need to change occupations, acquire new skills and learn to work alongside machines. There is also the risk that a skills divide furthers economic inequality. Such substantial changes will mean rethinking how societies, economies and governments respond and interact with each other. While substantial progress has been made in AI, the technology is still in a state of transition. A good example of this is the case of self-driving cars: despite initial enthusiasm, the expectation that they would be available to consumers has been steadily lowered. Regardless of AI\u2019s current state, the genie is now out of the bottle, so to speak. It is therefore necessary to start preparing for a future with AI. That will mean grappling with contentious and challenging issues, including those which go beyond jobs and labour market skills. Other considerations involve the ethical aspects of AI, including the potentially negative ways it could be used and exploited, from surveillance and censorship to biases and prejudices, which may be inherent within the programming. These questions may be dealt with in various ways. The establishment of Mohammed in Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence is an important and innovative step in the right direction and one that will help us fill in the blanks in our approach to the technology. As well as providing a space to prepare students and help them develop practical AI skills, it is an ideal for grappling with these broader issues and challenges.", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Why the Middle East is fast becoming a hub of artificial intelligence"}

The development of autonomous vehicles is the culmination of decades\u2019 worth of research on a range of technologies falling under the umbrella of \u2018Intelligent Transport Systems\u2019. Bringing them together - from simpler functions such as cruise control to the more advanced such as real-time road sensing and mapping - these intelligent systems can automate many vehicle functions. They can also increase efficiencies in traffic flow, fuel consumption and improve road safety. Although these systems can function without an internet connection, most of these technologies depend on communications with both the road network and other vehicles, sharing vast amounts of data. A debate is currently ongoing in the European Council as to which technology should be used for short-range communications, with the choice being between Wi-Fi and a 5G-based cellular network. However, the roll-out of 5G networks across Europe, which is now compulsory for all EU Member States, could circumvent this issue by providing long-range communications. 5G could offer internet speeds of over 100 gigabits a second - up to 200 times faster than 4G - opening the doors to a range of new technologies powered by hyper-connectivity. According to Digital Europe\u2019s Alberto Di Felice, the rollout of 5G would \u201callow for more advanced forms of connected autonomous vehicle functions as well as value-added, cloud-based services and more\u201d. Meanwhile, Joost Vantomme, Smart Mobility Director for vehicle manufacturers\u2019 association ACEA, believes the investment in 5G technology \u201cintroduces new dynamics and opportunities that enable the digitalisation of the transport sector\u201d. He said that \u201cautomation and connectivity are complementary and will reinforce each other in the medium to long term\u201d, adding that a big part of the \u20ac57.4bn that the automotive industry annually invests in R&D, is on connected and automated driving. Furthermore, by enhancing the communication network, information can be collected and fed back to service providers to improve the transport network. Insurance Europe\u2019s Nicolas Jeanmart said, \u201cInsights gleaned from driving behavioural data can be used in the development of new insurance products tailored to the profile of policyholders, such as driver feedback and coaching.\u201d \u201cGreater automation of vehicles is expected to reduce - if not remove entirely - the human error element of driving, which is likely to mean fewer road accidents overall,\u201d he added. Today, the EU is the biggest experimental area for 5G technology in the world, but ACEA\u2019s Vantomme believes that \u201ca pan-European network is needed to make the benefits of connected and automated driving widely available\u201d and would involve the roll-out of 5G infrastructure in transport-intensive areas such as motorways and cities. The EU has already begun this process by launching 5G connected roads or corridors across Europe, where technologies and systems are being tested. Furthermore, investments of more than \u20ac3bn have been earmarked, and last year the Commission produced its 5G Action Plan and observatory. Nevertheless, while deployment remains uneven across Europe, seamlessly-connected autonomous driving across borders may take a little longer before the fantasy becomes reality.", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Autonomous driving: A glimpse into the future"}
{"_id": "471876160233_10162164224520234", "content": "To mark its 15th anniversary, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) published the seventh edition of its Threat Landscape report. Looking at the changes from 2012, we see a range of threats that we haven\u2019t seen previously and old threats with increasing sophistication and destructive power. Adversaries, modus operandi and motives are changing over time, with hackers becoming entrepreneurs by setting up businesses or even working for governments as cyber agents. These changes have a profound impact on the importance of cybersecurity, as it has become possible to use cyberspace to shape elections or shutdown a country\u2019s power grid. Cybersecurity is assuming an increasingly critical role in economy and society, highlighting our growing dependency on cyberspace to run our daily lives. There are numerous reasons for this rate of change. However, one reason stands out; a pattern that is changing the cybersecurity paradigm - the \u2018datafication\u2019 of everything This is a pattern emerging from the quest to transform every aspect of our human existence into quantified data. From a simple perspective, this \u2018datafication\u2019 is about recording any type of activity and turning it into data that can be monitored, tracked, analysed and optimised. What makes \u2018datafication\u2019 a pattern is mainly the fact that everyone loves data. Governments use it to define policies, plan strategies and allocate resources; researchers use it to stimulate advances in science; industries use it to monitor and control manufacturing processes and businesses to study and define strategies that attract and influence customers. As individuals, we are also addicted to data, behaving like \u2018dataholics\u2019. The amount of data collected, stored and processed per person is growing as we move more information and activities into the digital space. For example, the use of visual data such as images, pictures and videos will become a norm for individuals to communicate, replacing the existing text-based approach. Audio data is already growing beyond traditional telephony systems, with digital personal assistants gaining growing importance in our digital lives. Cybersecurity - and threat analysis in particular - relies on data, defined as indicators of compromise. The deluge of data generated by security monitoring and detection systems goes beyond what is humanly possible to handle and digest. With advances in data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, the processing and analysis of all this data may finally become possible. The insights produced by AI algorithms can be used to train defence systems to protect themselves from cyberattacks. This perspective holds great promise; however adversaries can also leverage the potential of AI to breach traditional defences and undertake attacks. One of the threats relates to the fact that AI algorithms are a black box, where audit and validation are simply not possible. As an example, any malicious modification of the data used to train AI algorithms for autonomous systems can have unforeseeable and devastating consequences on how a vehicle behaves. Other threats include the use of AI to automate tasks involved in surveillance - such as analysing bulk-collected data; persuasion - through creating targeted propaganda; and deception - manipulating videos and facial recognition. Novel attacks may also take advantage of an improved capacity to analyse human behaviour, moods and beliefs on the basis of available data. For all these, it is reasonable to assume that the appetite for, and the importance of, data will only escalate. This makes its protection of paramount importance. \u2018Datafication\u2019 is changing the nature of cybersecurity and how we view threats and protect systems from potential attacks. The danger of inappropriate use of data goes beyond privacy and data protection issues and expands beyond traditional threats. It includes how data, collected for valid and legitimate purposes, may be unethically and sometimes illicitly used - through the use of AI algorithms - to limit, sway and manipulate individuals\u2019 actions, opinions and decisions. The boundaries of the acceptable collection, transmission, processing and use of data need to be clearly-defined to protect against the risk of abuse. In future editions of ENISA threat landscape, we will see new trends associated with the abuse of data from the \u201cdatafication\u201d. This \u2018weaponisation\u2019 of data by using AI will be seen as an alarming trend, likely to be a leading future threat. These concerns will be further exacerbated by the fact that it will take time for cybersecurity professionals to identify and mitigate these type of threats and to reduce their impact. New strategies will reinforce protection mechanisms, but it will remain the responsibility of individuals and organisations to adopt stringent criteria on what to share, collect and retain.", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Threats in the digital shadows"}
{"_id": "471876160233_10161913762080234", "content": "While the Internet of Things already exists on a smaller scale, 5G will revolutionise its opportunities in the coming years, thanks to its large capacity, fast speeds and almost zero latency. 5G could, for example, be a game-changer for the transport industry by enabling the deployment of self-driving vehicles that can liaise with other vehicles, pedestrians and roadside infrastructure. Likewise, in the field of healthcare, it will allow the development of new types of medical devices and applications such as remote surgery. My own country, Estonia, has been a frontrunner in testing and deploying 5G networks. Estonia was one of the first countries where the public was able to experience the high speeds of 5G in the Port of Tallinn. Network companies, mobile operators and technology companies in Estonia have also been experimenting with different applications for 5G. For example, the Digital Summit organised during the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the EU in 2017 featured a demonstration with an excavator operated from a distance through a 5G network, and last year there was even the world\u2019s first 5G concert connecting musicians from two different Estonian cities. Estonia\u2019s aim is to reach 5G connectivity in its larger cities and suburbs by 2023, and in the main transport corridors by 2025. This is in line with the general EU targets set in the 5G Action Plan during the Estonian Presidency. However, it seems highly likely that more-rural and sparsely populated areas in Europe will have to stick with 4G technology - or in the worst case, even slower previous generation networks - for the near future. Many of these areas already struggle with poor connectivity, be it through mobile networks or broadband coverage. The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) has pointed out that slower internet penetration in rural areas, outermost regions or sparsely populated areas presents an obstacle to achieving the EU\u2019s ambitious goals for the Digital Single Market, and more widely, to the economic and social cohesion in Europe. This has also been recognised by the European Commission, which has set up - with the CoR - a joint Broadband Platform of local and regional policymakers along with experts. The first results of its work have been summarised in a \u2018Digital Europe for All\u2019 report, drafted by the CoR President Karl-Heinz Lambertz and First Vice-President Markku Markkula. The European Commission warmly welcomed this at this year\u2019s Digital Assembly in Bucharest in June, while the current Finnish Presidency of the Council also wants to hear our opinion on this important topic. We at the CoR are urging the next Commission to support cities and communities in their digital transformation and to ensure the economic and social benefits to all local communities and their citizens. Let me stress that the digital transformation can over huge opportunities for rural areas and their communities, from teleworking to remote healthcare or new forms of smart mobility. In fact, granting high-speed connectivity to all Europeans could be the most effective way to tackle brain-drain and demographic decline that many rural areas face. Here, local and regional communities and governments have a key role, as they are responsible for 50 percent of public investment in the EU, receive 25 percent of tax revenues and are major public employers. We believe that cities and regions can jointly drive the digital revolution, but they need the means to do so. The EU\u2019s cohesion policy remains a key tool here, together with the EU\u2019s other financial instruments such as the Connecting Europe facility, the new Digital Europe programme or InvestEU. These can be combined with other forms of funding, such as loan financing, in cooperation with the European Investment Bank and other development banks. To make the most of 5G connectivity, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and other new technologies, it is important to work across borders to ensure that standards and solutions developed in EU regions are fully interoperable. Furthermore, with the development of Internet of Things, ensuring the security of data becomes more and more crucial. As 5G will be used in critical fields, such as the transport and health sectors, it must be reliable and not vulnerable to external attacks. In conclusion, 5G will be the most important building block of the digital society in the next decade. The EU wide introduction of new innovative products and services it facilitates depends on the entire EU enjoying full high-speed internet coverage. For this reason, cities and regions insist that inclusiveness has to be at the heart of Europe\u2019s digital strategy.", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Bringing 5G to all corners of Europe"}
{"_id": "471876160233_10161910446945234", "content": "It will provide us with high-quality connectivity services that far beyond the levels we currently enjoy with 4G, tailor-made to suit different industries and business practices. This will mean that 5G will be about far more than simply smartphones; it will also allow provide companies with seamless access to exciting new technologies such as artificial intelligence and supercomputing and pave the way for the Next-Generation Internet and the Internet of Things. The benefits of 5G also go further than technological advances; it overs huge potential for sustainable growth and jobs in Europe and will hold the key to solving many of the challenges we face, from improving road safety to lowering carbon emissions or delivering personalised healthcare. However, for these benefits to become a reality, we need the right strategy and policies in place that will help 5G flourish and grow. The European Commission has been working on just that for many years already. In 2013, we launched a large-scale research programme called the 5G Public-Private Partnership (5G-PPP), the first in the world to develop 5G as we currently know it. With over \u20ac700m in public investment, we have been able to mobilise \u20ac5bn in total, ensuring Europe\u2019s leading position in terms of research and development. With this basic research in place, we turned our attention to supporting the practical rollout and proposed the 5G Action Plan in 2016. It called on industry stakeholders and Member States to designate at least one 5G-enabled city per country by 2020, setting a target for nationwide rollout of 2025. While setting these targets is important, we also need to make sure that we are on track to meet them. This is why last year we created the European 5G Observatory to monitor progress of commercial launches, city trials and highway corridors. The latest report shows that Europe is very much on track for the commercial launch of 5G this year: there are currently 147 major 5G trials ongoing around Europe, with a total planned investment of \u20ac1bn (including \u20ac300m from the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 research programme). As with all technological advances, the launch of commercial 5G services will be just the tip of the iceberg. In the beginning, 5G is likely to focus primarily on the consumer market, offering an improved experience over 4G but within a more limited geographical area. But we fully expect the pace of development to increase rapidly once 5G is launched. The 5G of today is not the 5G of five years\u2019 time, and certainly not the 5G that could be driving our cars and flying our drones by the end of the next decade. While the EU can do a lot to encourage the rapid development of 5G infrastructure and services, it cannot do it alone. Private sector investment will also be needed to develop not only the services but also, just as importantly, the ecosystem in which 5G can thrive. As far as the EU is concerned, we estimate that investments in 5G from the private sector will amount to \u20ac60-100bn annually in the coming five years. We believe that 5G in its most advanced form will be available mainly in areas with high demand from business and industry, meaning that 4G will continue to play an important role in parallel for many users. The benefits that 5G delivers for high-value applications such as automated driving or smart factories will ultimately determine the pace of change. And as businesses and their supply chains develop these applications, they will inevitably look to partner with communities: a connected car that needs 5G connectivity will not be able to travel very far if the relevant coverage is limited. Therefore, the development of the technology, applications and public infrastructure will have to go hand-in-hand. Concerns over the security of 5G networks have raised questions over the EU\u2019s strategic autonomy in high-speed network technology. The European Commission has been swift to act, publishing a recommendation to ensure a joint view of cybersecurity needs of 5G networks across Europe. Of course, Member States are responsible for their own national security, but we must have a common approach to tackling security risks so as not to fragment the European single market. This is why we have proposed that Member States work together and develop a joint risk assessment and a common toolbox of mitigation measures (under the Network and Information Security Directive). To ensure Europe\u2019s technological independence in this crucial domain, we are now preparing an ambitious new partnership, building on the current 5G-PPP. This reinforced partnership will strengthen our ecosystem and support user industries, ultimately leading us towards a future beyond 5G. It will also play an active role in building so-called 5G corridors for connected and automated mobility, as proposed in the Connecting Europe Facility in Telecom (CEF). Many of the services that 5G will facilitate are in the public interest, which is why we aim to increase public investments in the technology under the new EU budget in programmes such as Horizon Europe, the Digital Europe Programme, CEF in Telecom and InvestEU. The European Parliament has played an important role in all of this, from the early days of the 5G-PPP to the Parliament resolution on the 5G Action Plan. We look forward to continuing a fruitful collaboration with the new Parliament in the years to come, as we continue our shared journey towards the connected Europe of the future.", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Letting 5G flourish"}

It has the ability to connect everything around us, from our phones and fridges to hospitals and energy grids, driving economic growth and improving our everyday lives. But there are also concerns that this radical transformation is fraught with risks and Europe may be unprepared for its challenges. This was the main message of an event in the European Parliament in early November entitled \u201cCybersecurity: What are the real risks?\u201d The debate comprised of two panels led by MEPs Maria Spyraki (EPP, Greece) and John Howarth (S&D, UK), with the support of The Parliament Magazine and the Chinese Mission to the EU. According to a recent European Commission report, due to the interdependencies between 5G networks and many other systems in critical areas like health, autonomous driving, power, water supply and defence, the degradation of 5G services may lead to significant disruptions of these systems. As such, with so many more goods, services and sectors connected to the internet and dependent on the capabilities provided by 5G infrastructure, their cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important with many panellists saying this can only be accomplished through global cooperation and standard setting. However, according to Spyraki, the recent Osaka Declaration on the Digital Economy underlined that there are some divisions among countries on the very definition of cybersecurity and its standards. This is because cybersecurity is seen as a national competence, therefore many are reluctant to share the information needed to enhance global cybersecurity. China\u2019s director of cyber affairs from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yue Ping, felt that national politics was hindering development, saying, \u201cwe must not let fabricated provisional issues get in the way of digital economic development, even less allow political issues that undermine the multilateral efforts to generally improve cybersecurity.\u201d With Huawei dominating the European market, there are concerns that a dominant foreign player could exploit its position to control others or even leave some countries vulnerable to attack, unless Europe sets out its own rules. Professor Bart Preneel, a Belgian cryptographer, cyber expert and ENISA stakeholder, said, \u201cWe\u2019re so behind that this [cybersecurity] would actually be a way to regain leadership, or at least to catch up.\u201d However, Portuguese S&D deputy Carlos Zorrinho argued that if the EU wants to compete in cybersecurity it first needs to establish a \u201cdigital identity\u201d which encompasses Europe\u2019s shared ethical values, such as transparency and putting citizens\u2019 needs first. \u201cIf Google, Facebook and Amazon want to work here, they can but only as a European company with a European digital identity and our ethics,\u201d he said. Another risk raised was that of \u2018backdoors\u2019 - undocumented portals setup by manufacturers to provide access to a device or network system. These are also created to provide national security agencies and law enforcement with access to users\u2019 data, meaning that one country might be able to access another country\u2019s data, which in turn raises national security concerns. This was a recurrent theme in the debate, with one audience member asking, \u201cHuawei is like any other Chinese company, committed by law to cooperate with Chinese intelligence. So, can we build trust and common regulatory frameworks in this kind of situation?\u201d Ping responded by saying that she believes trust is an important issue, but blamed other countries for creating an atmosphere of mistrust when she asked, \u201cwho broke the trust?\u201d The US Mission to the EU was invited to participate in the conference but had declined the invitation. However, among the audience was Huawei\u2019s representative, Sophie Batas, Director for Cyber Security and Privacy Policy, who said trust was an essential element in developing cybersecurity competence, adding, \u201cWe are trying to build trust and we work on any EU approach that does this.\u201d According to Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez-Sancho from the European Commission, cybersecurity is \u201cat the top of the political agenda\u201d and the EU is taking a three-pronged approach using legislation, funding and soft policy to establish European leadership. The NIS (security of network and information systems) Directive and the forthcoming Cyber Security Act provide legal measures aimed at boosting the EU\u2019s cybersecurity competence and strengthening the role of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), while greater funding is being proposed for the EU\u2019s upcoming Horizon Europe and Digital Europe research and innovation programmes to look specifically at cybersecurity and competence building. On soft policy, the Commission representative said work had already begun on a toolbox, or catalogue, of cybersecurity guidance and \u201cmitigating measures\u201d which draws on the input of EU Member State governments and should be available by the end of the year. However, Professor Preneel was unconvinced by the Commission\u2019s so-called \u201cCyber Diplomacy Toolbox\u201d, describing it as \u201canother name for common criteria\u201d, internationally-set guidelines and specifications developed for evaluating and certifying the security of IT products. This is an approach \u201cthat has failed for 25 years\u201d and has resulted in \u201cnot one digital product being certified by the International Standards Organization,\u201d Preneel added. With more devices connected to the internet, there are more opportunities for exploitation. Chuck Davis, senior director for cybersecurity at Hikvision, the world\u2019s biggest video surveillance company, warned, \u201cWhen you buy a smart refrigerator, that means it\u2019s a computer refrigerator \u2026 but now the risk has increased greatly when you connect this device to the internet, with 4.5 billion users worldwide.\u201d Closing the event, UK Socialist MEP John Howarth concluded, \u201cIt is crucial to equip citizens with the necessary skills to be vigilant to so many of the challenges and threats encountered on a daily basis, and this could well be an area of common ground for the EU, China and the US.\u201d", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Cybersecurity: What are the risks?"}

From drones barking orders at park-goers to tracing people's movements through cellphones, Western governments are rushing to embrace sophisticated surveillance tools that would have been unthinkable just a few weeks ago. In the European Union, home to the world's strictest privacy regimen , leaders have taken the unprecedented step of asking telecoms companies to hand over mobile phone data so they can track population movements and try to stop the spread. The European Commission has gone further, asking all such data to be centralized to speed up prevention across the bloc, three people involved in the talks told POLITICO . But epidemiologists argue that such efforts are only a first step: To be fully effective, some say, the EU will have to follow the example of South Korea and China and make infected people download an app that would reveal exactly where they go and whom they meet. \u201cIt would be much more efficient [to stop the spread of the coronavirus] if everyone had the same app,\u201d said Sune Lehmann J\u00f8rgensen, a professor at the Technical University of Denmark who is advising the government on how best to track the coronavirus. \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t just institute global surveillance. [The] 9/11 [attacks] showed us that in times of crisis, we can erode people\u2019s rights.\" While governments seek out more effective tracking tools, companies best known for providing digital surveillance for security forces are proving only too happy to oblige. Some, like the Israeli NSO Group and facial recognition company Clearview AI, have barely emerged from controversies about their practices, while others, like U.S.-based Palantir, are closely linked to the intelligence and defense communities in the United States. The race to embrace invasive tools underscores a simple dynamic at play during the current global pandemic: Public health concerns are trumping the desire to protect individuals' privacy online and in the real world, even in the home of the General Data Protection Regulation, Europe's sweeping privacy rules. And so far, regulators and the public are largely standing by. \u201cThe acceptance level for tracking is higher,\" said Staffan Truv\u00e9, chief technology officer of cybersecurity intelligence firm Recorded Future. \"Everyone feels at risk. The personal benefit of briefly giving up your privacy feels much bigger than with terrorist attacks.\u201d Apps for the infected Just a few weeks ago, when the pandemic was still a distant fear, privacy advocates latched on to a clip of Chinese police ordering an elderly woman back into her home via drone-mounted loudspeaker as an example of Big Brother tactics gone awry. Now, drones are deployed in Brussels, the heart of Europe's institutional capital, to enforce social-distancing rules, and stay-at-home orders are being broadcast through the streets of German cities. The speed with which such solutions have not just been rolled out, but also been largely accepted by anxious populations is prompting critics to warn of a danger to democracy. In Israel, the government last week approved sweeping new emergency surveillance powers that allow authorities to enforce quarantine orders and warn people about potentially infectious encounters. Despite the potential for snooping and privacy breaches, the EU has said it would continue to approve the transfer of data about EU citizens to Israel. And some European lawmakers are already calling for similar surveillance powers closer to home. In France, two conservative senators last week tabled an amendment that would authorize telecoms operators to collect health and location data on all mobile phone users for six months. It was defeated, but telecoms-to-government data transfers are happening on an ad hoc basis. In Brussels, Thierry Breton, the EU's Internal Markets Commissioner, has been at the forefront of efforts to get companies to share data. During a conference call with executives from telecoms giants, including Deutsche Telekom and Orange, the Frenchman asked them to hand over so-called metadata, or peripheral information stripped of individual identifiers, on millions of people's mobile phones. \u201cThe whole idea [in sharing mobile data with governments] is to be ahead of the curve,\" said Frederic Pivetta, the founder of Dalberg, a data analytics firm that has been contracted by the Belgian government to use telecom data to map the spread of the coronavirus. \"This exercise is meant to flatten the curve, so less people are going to be infected because you know where the infected people are today.\" As governments take similar steps across the EU, they can look to Norway for an example of how it can be implemented. Telenor, the local carrier, has been sharing aggregated mobile data with scientists for three weeks, according to Arnoldo Frigessi, a statistician at the University of Oslo involved in the project. He said that his team had been able to track a roughly 60 percent drop in people moving between municipalities by tracking smartphone movements. But now that most people were staying at home, Frigessi said more needs to be done to ensure people are staying separated. His team is helping the Norwegian government to create its own smartphone app in the coming weeks to give greater insight into individuals\u2019 activities. An app \"is a completely different story,\" he said. Norway is not alone. Spain, Romania, Slovakia and Poland have already created their own version of these apps, which experiences in South Korea, Hong Kong and China suggest can be highly effective in slowing the spread of disease. 'False reassurance' The rush to embrace data-sharing and even apps that track infected people's whereabouts raises the question: Where are Europe's data regulators? For now, they are largely keeping an eye on developments and even in some cases giving their blessings to new data-collection initiatives. \u201cI\u2019m observing how in the corona pandemic, other countries are neglecting data protection in parts,\" said Ulrich Kelber, who's in charge of the federal privacy regulator in Germany. \"But in Germany I don\u2019t see any reason for that because all solutions can be designed so that they don't infringe upon fundamental rights.\" Kelber endorsed a scheme under which Deutsche Telekom, the local carrier, handed over 5 gigabytes of data on its 46 million mobile customers to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's national disease control center. Across the border in Austria, top data regulator Andrea Jelinek, has done the same for similar data-sharing plans. Such aggregated data does not offer granular information on people's everyday movements. \u201cRest assured that all offices are watching this [data-transfer practice] closely,\u201d Jelinek, who also chairs the EDPB, Europe's umbrella group of privacy authorities, told POLITICO. \u201cPeople have other concerns right now than hollowing out data protection standards.\" But privacy advocates strongly disagree. Pointing to a wave of new surveillance powers approved nationally and EU-wide in 2015- 2017, following a wave of terrorist attacks, critics argue that regulators are green-lighting practices that will be almost impossible to unwind once the pandemic has passed. Patrick Breyer, a German MEP, said that once approved, mobile data-sharing schemes would set a dangerous precedent for real-time monitoring of meetings and gatherings. \u201cThere can be many reasons why you would want to meet in private without being tracked by the government and without alerting them to it,\" he said. \"It's important in a democracy, and even more important in autocratic regimes, where people need to meet in secret, to make sure that they are not exposed to a government crackdown.\" According to European Commissioner Breton and other top officials urging telecoms operators to hand over data, privacy can be respected because the data concerned is anonymized and aggregated. But that is a little reassurance, according to privacy experts who point out that an individual's identity can easily be deduced from just a handful of anonymized mobile phone location data points. \"The challenge with this data is that we don't believe it can be anonymized,\" said Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, head of the computational privacy group at Imperial College London, whose research found that almost all people could be personally identified from just four pieces of anonymized mobile phone data. \"It comes down to what is reasonable and proportionate.\" Laura Kayali contributed reporting.

As companies across Europe and the United States order employees to work from home, the focus of the working day has shifted to messaging applications and conference call platforms. But any sense that employees are flying under the radar is misplaced. Working from home may in fact increase workplace surveillance, as in-person conversations move to videoconferencing apps that tell your boss whether you\u2019re paying attention, or messaging apps that your boss can access. Take Zoom: Use of the videoconferencing app has boomed as offices have closed. But what you may not know is that it has an \u201cattendee attention tracking\u201d feature that allows hosts to track if attendees click away from the app. \u201cHosts can see an indicator in the participant panel of a meeting or webinar if an attendee does not have Zoom Desktop Client or Mobile App in focus for more than 30 seconds. 'In focus' means the user has the Zoom meeting view is open and active,\u201d reads a section of its help page. As knowledge of the feature has percolated, users have taken to Twitter to voice concern. Mia Hamano, whose Twitter bio lists her as a product manager at brand consultancy Buffer, said Zoom\u2019s attention tracking metric was \u201ca bit extreme.\u201d \u201cOften times I have other documents that I'm looking at in Zoom meetings \u2026 so I'm not necessarily going to be staring at a person\u2019s face for the entirety of the call,\u201d she wrote. Another popular conferencing app, UberConference, boasts on its features page that it provides users with a detailed transcript of their calls including who said what \u2014 and sends it straight to a note-taking app. \u201cUberConference will show you a quick conference summary after every call, as well as automatically email you a detailed report with a Voice Intelligence summary, transcript, call recordings, participant information and statistics, as well as a time log,\u201d it says on its features page \u2014 a far cry from the sleepy morning meeting. The app also gives users a breakdown of employees' calling habits, from the number of calls they have made, to the average length of the call. While these creepy features don't have to be used, the advice that some remote workers have been receiving suggests they will be. The Wall Street Journal instructed its staff to \"respond within just a few minutes\" to Slack or Google Hangout messages and to let managers know if they are taking a break, in meetings, conducting interviews or if they will \"otherwise be unavailable for a while.\" It\u2019s not just video conferencing apps that will facilitate bosses Orwellian tendencies. Slack, a messaging platform aimed at workplaces, also has some features that should give you pause. One, if you\u2019re on a paid plan, is that it may allow your boss to read your direct messages. !function(e,t,i,n,r,d){function o(e,i,n,r){t[s].list.push({id:e,title:r,container:i,type:n})}var a=\"script\",s=\"InfogramEmbeds\",c=e.getElementsByTagName(a),l=c[0];if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&&0===t.location.protocol.indexOf(\"file\")&&(i=\"http:\"+i),!t[s]){t[s]={script:i,list:[]};var m=e.createElement(a);m.async=1,m.src=i,l.parentNode.insertBefore(m,l)}t[s].add=o;var p=c[c.length-1],f=e.createElement(\"div\");p.parentNode.insertBefore(f,p),t[s].add(n,f,r,d)}(document,window,\"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",\"082347d4-f468-419e-b813-ef81b13fccaf\",\"interactive\",\"\"); \u201cWorkspace Owners can apply to access Corporate Export, a self-serve export tool that permits a Workspace Owner to export content from private channels and one to one or group direct messages as needed and permitted by law,\u201d Slack literature reads .

{"_id": "587266261407195_1919772684823206", "content": "This article is part of a special report on artificial intelligence, The AI Issue . Ready for your closeup? Your face could soon be included in police databases searchable by law enforcement across the European Union. The Council of the EU has been advised to include photos of the Continent\u2019s residents in a network of databases that could be searched by police using facial recognition software, according to an internal report circulated by the Austrian government and obtained by POLITICO. These photos could include pictures culled from driver\u2019s licenses and passports, if another recommendation obtained by POLITICO and circulated by the Finnish presidency of the Council last year were to be adopted. The recommendations were made by focus groups comprising of representatives of EU countries and tasked by the Council with coming up with ways to improve an existing system, called the Pr\u00fcm network, that police already use to share information across borders. Currently, Pr\u00fcm requires all EU member countries to interconnect their fingerprint, DNA and vehicle registration databases for mutual searching \u2014 but it does not yet include facial imagery. The proposals, if realized, would allow a police officer in one country to feed a picture into the Pr\u00fcm network, and compare it to millions of faces in every other member country\u2019s databases. Were the system to detect a match, police officers would have to approve any further exchange of data, like names or addresses. The report on facial recognition emphasizes that national laws should continue to govern the storage and use of images. Brussels would only set the rules for cross-border searches. Reinhard Schmid, a senior official with the Austrian criminal intelligence service who is participating in the Pr\u00fcm discussions on behalf of Vienna, said the system has been \u201cthe most successful tool we have in criminal investigation,\u201d and \u201cthe most important tool that we have to identify international criminality.\u201d He noted that the Austrian state holds vast numbers of facial images \u2014 for example, from driver's licenses \u2014 but currently, police can only search criminal photo databases. Privacy advocates worry Pr\u00fcm\u2019s expansion into facial recognition would be ripe for abuse. \u201cIn many places in the EU today, facial images are almost ubiquitously taken by surveillance cameras in public spaces,\u201d said Jan Penfrat, senior policy adviser at European Digital Rights, a privacy advocate. \u201cOnce our facial images have been analyzed and digitized by facial recognition software, automated systems across the EU will be able to recognize us wherever we go. We will never be anonymous again.\u201d Starting Small The first effort to combine police biometric databases in the EU was in 2005, through a convention signed by seven member countries in the small German town of Pr\u00fcm. The resulting Pr\u00fcm network interconnected the DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration databases of the seven signatory states. In 2008 the convention became EU law, extending the same obligations to all member countries. Since then, national biometric databases have grown extensively. Internal police data on DNA databases provided to the Council of the EU, reviewed by POLITICO, show some striking increases. In 2013, the French database held over 2.2 million samples, coming either from known individuals \u2014 such as those arrested and convicted \u2014 or from \u201cstains\u201d found at crime scenes. Five years later, that database had more than doubled in size. DNA databases in the Czech Republic, Spain, Hungary, Poland and Romania, while not as large, have grown at a similar rate. Despite the rapid expansion of these data banks, the exchange of biometric data among European police forces has faced significant legal, technical and procedural hurdles. After the Pr\u00fcm legislation came into force in 2008, police found they had issues using biometric data from other countries in court, explained Carole McCartney, a law professor at the University of Northumbria, in Newcastle. In 2009, further EU legislation was introduced to ensure that all EU forensic science laboratories meet the same standards. The reports recommending the addition of facial imagery are part of a process involving the Commission, the Council and EU member countries that is looking at expanding the Pr\u00fcm system. The report circulated by Austria addresses the inclusion of facial recognition in the network. The one distributed by the Finnish presidency suggests ways to improve the sharing of vehicle registration and driver\u2019s license data, including photographs. Other focus groups are looking at ways to improve the handling of fingerprints and DNA data. The findings have been discussed  in the Council\u2019s Working Party on Information Exchange and Data Protection (DAPIX), a group that handles legislation and policies on the exchange and protection of personal data in the field of law enforcement. Facial flaws The expansion of Pr\u00fcm into facial imagery has been criticized by privacy advocates and experts skeptical of the system. Facial recognition technology is particularly prone to confuse the faces of women and people of color, raising concerns over gender bias and racial discrimination. The focus group on facial recognition argued against including a quality standard for imagery, however, and suggested that data from surveillance cameras, which often capture blurry or incomplete facial portraits, be included. \u201cSince the main objective of the cooperation will be the identification of unknown persons on the basis of mostly poor data quality search images, searches in the reference databases of the Pr\u00fcm partners must be possible with poor image quality,\u201d the report states, adding that the system \u201cshould be allowed to transmit and process very poor trace image qualities to carry out comparisons.\u201d The proposal is \u201ca dystopian horror story\u201d that \u201cwould create a completely incoherent legal landscape within the EU,\u201d said Cornelia Ernst, an MEP with the left-wing GUE/NGL group. \u201cAt the end of the day, it would be full of loopholes. Protection levels would be severely undermined, and data quality nearly unmeasurable.\u201d Some experts say it is difficult to gauge Pr\u00fcm\u2019s effectiveness. The EU does not release overall statistics about the number of cases solved under Pr\u00fcm, or the amount of searches made that result in false positives. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly any statistical information about the number of exchanges, the number of matches, the number of matches being followed up by local police authorities,\u201d said Victor Toom, a forensic science specialist who has studied the field for over 15 years. \u201cIf there's one thing that the Pr\u00fcm system is not, it\u2019s transparent. And if it lacks transparency how can it be accountable?\u201d Rafaela Granja, a sociologist at the University of Minho in Portugal who studies the transnational sharing of DNA data, said that even if systems are improved, the Pr\u00fcm network itself doesn\u2019t have sufficient oversight mechanisms. \u201cWe have no way of actually assessing if this system is indeed contributing to international crime-fighting,\u201d said Granja. \u201cProfessionals working with it say it has a positive impact, but it cannot be measured with the data available. Unless you solve some of the very prominent issues that we have in the system as it is now, I would argue against expanding it.\u201d Still, law enforcement officials are convinced of the system\u2019s benefits. A spokesperson from the Spanish interior ministry said that the expansion of Pr\u00fcm to handle facial recognition data, the addition of driver\u2019s license and passport photos and the creation of a centralized EU database would all be \"an improvement\" on the current system. In Germany, the federal criminal police agree. \u201cThe Pr\u00fcm network has proven its efficiency today with fingerprint, DNA and vehicle registration data,\u201d said Daniil Kushnerovich, a police spokesperson. \u201cIt is now time to expand the mechanisms to other kinds of data, like facial images. [We] therefore strongly support the EU Commission\u2019s plans to revise the legal and the technical basis for Pr\u00fcm.\u201d \u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 Since late 2018, the European Commission has spent more than \u20ac1 million studying ways to expand the Pr\u00fcm network, including nearly \u20ac700,000 to the consultancy firm Deloitte. That work is currently being finalized and has addressed the possibility of including facial recognition, said a Commission spokesperson. According to the focus group on facial recognition, Deloitte\u2019s consultants raised the possibility of creating a centralized police facial image database at the EU level, but the police experts involved in the working group rejected it. Schmid, the official with the Austrian criminal intelligence service, confirmed this account. \u201cAll suggestions of the study contractor towards a data storage of personal or case data on central servers of the EU \u2026 were unanimously and strictly rejected by all experts because of legal as well as of forensic and organizational reasons,\u201d reads the document. Deloitte officials declined to comment for this story, citing confidentiality requirements. The Commission denied that any such suggestion was ever made. Depending on national laws, police forces already have access to vast numbers of facial images, beyond mugshots of those arrested or convicted. An EU \u201cManual on Law Enforcement Information Exchange\u201d dated June 2019 and seen by POLITICO lists the \u201cinformation/databases managed and directly accessible by law enforcement authorities\u201d in every member state. They include databases of identity cards, passports, driving licenses and residence permits. \u2014 The focus group on facial recognition suggested these images be included in any pan-EU facial recognition system: \u201cEvery possible hit from every database which is able to be searched should be provided,\u201d it says. The Commission has also provided \u20ac500,000 to a project called Towards the European Level Exchange of Facial Images (TELEFI) , which is working to locate every source of facial recognition data available to police in the EU, with the eventual goal of merging them into one pan-European network. \u201cThe TELEFI project will review the organizational, technical and legal aspects of facial recognition in connection with the investigation and prosecution of crime across Europe,\u201d reads a project presentation obtained by POLITICO, in order to \u201crecognize the status and position of the Member States to move towards the possible exchange of Facial Data.\u201d The presentation also poses the question of whether recorded speech could be added to Pr\u00fcm in the future. Andra Sirgmets, the project manager, and \u00dcllar Lanno, director of the Estonian Forensic Science Institute, the lead institution on the TELEFI project, both declined to answer questions. Though the expansion of the Pr\u00fcm system to facial recognition and the inclusion of images from driver's licenses, passports, residence cards and other identity documents would vastly expand the police\u2019s ability to locate unknown suspects, for some experts it raises more profound questions about the rights of citizens in a liberal democracy. \u201cThat\u2019s just a Pandora\u2019s Box there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said McCartney, the Northumbria University law professor. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is, for me to own a car and to drive, I have to submit that my photo and information is going to be used for policing purposes across the entire EU,\u201d she added. \u201cAre we all walking around as citizens?

{"_id": "587266261407195_1608443625956115", "content": "PARIS \u2014 Donald Trump's administration has finally found an international agreement it can support. At an annual meeting on Wednesday, the 36 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) plus a handful of other nations are set to adopt a list of guidelines for the development and use of artificial intelligence. The agreement, seen by POLITICO, marks the first time that the United States \u2014 home to some of the world's largest and most powerful tech companies \u2014 has endorsed international guidelines for the emerging technologies. China, the second global front-runner in the field, is not a member of the OECD. Over four pages, the agreement lays out a series of broad principles designed to ensure that as AI develops, the technology will benefit humanity rather than harming it, and urges governments to draft policies for such \"responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI.\" However, the document omits the matter of whether or not binding rules would be necessary to regulate the technology \u2014 a question that divides policymakers and researchers around the world. \u201cAt this stage \u2026 it\u2019s completely premature to know whether and what to regulate when it comes to AI,\u201d Anne Carblanc, the head of the OECD\u2019s digital economy policy division, told POLITICO during an interview at the group\u2019s headquarters in the French capital. Carblanc, a former judge, said that AI affects too many sectors to be covered by one-for-all rules, and that much of the technology \u2014 including questions of accountability and liability \u2014 is already covered by existing national regulation as well as by international human rights law. Rather than being a blueprint for hard global rules, the idea behind the OECD\u2019s principles is to \u201cprovide a clear orientation to what are the fundamental values that need to be respected,\u201d she stressed. By embracing such principles, countries express their \"political commitment\" to implementing them, she added \u2014 a process that will be monitored and reviewed by her group. The OECD also hopes that the principles will have an impact beyond their own members. At this year's G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, the OECD wants to encourage member countries \u2014 which includes non-OECD nations such as China \u2014 to express support for their principles, in one form or another, according to officials. Are you a machine? The guidelines, due to be released on Wednesday, were drafted by a group of 50 experts from the industry, governments, trade unions, the civil society as well as tech companies. The final document starts by pledging that AI should be designed to respect the rule of law, human rights and democratic values. It adds that AI systems should be safe and transparent, that people should know whether or not they\u2019re dealing with a machine, and that those developing or deploying AI should be held accountable for their actions. The OECD also urges governments to boost public and private investment in AI, set up open datasets for developers and support efforts to share data. Governments should also review legal frameworks to make it easier to turn research into market-ready applications, for example by creating deregulated environments to test technology, the OECD says. Research into AI goes back to the 1950s. But only in recent years have a boost in computing power, the emergence of cloud computing and unprecedented masses of data turned it from blue-sky research into technology that powers day-to-day applications. The technologies offer opportunities, from better treatment of cancer patients to saving energy to tackling climate change, but they also come with significant risks. Most of today\u2019s cutting-edge AI systems, for example, are prone to mirroring biases from the analog world and to discriminating against minorities. AI also poses unprecedented challenges to privacy, as shown by media reports suggesting that China is using state-of-the-art AI to build an omnipresent surveillance system targeting vulnerable groups. Against this backdrop, the European Union released detailed guidelines for what it calls \u201ctrustworthy\u201d artificial intelligence in March \u2014 technology that respects European values and is engineered in a way that prevents it from causing intentional or unintentional harm. The EU's push into writing the guiding principles was watched closely by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who himself called for regulating AI in an executive order in February. Alarmed by the fact that the EU's set of sweeping new privacy rules implemented last year could soon become a global standard for data protection, U.S. officials reportedly intensified cooperation with the OECD on the international AI guidelines. \"The U.S. was interested in pursuing this,\" said the OECD's Carblanc, who oversaw the development of the principles on the working level. \"At the OECD, they're very present on everything digital, so I believe they thought it was the right place to do something.\" In line with the group's traditional \"soft power\" approach to exert influence through peer pressure, the idea for the principles is to influence practice by serving as a framework for both national governments drafting legislation and corporations writing up their own guidelines for the development of AI. There are several past examples that could serve as a precedent, officials say.

BND director Bruno Kahl said during a hearing in the German parliament in October that Huawei \u201ccannot be fully trusted.\u201d In a speech last Wednesday, Merkel reaffirmed her decision not to exclude \u201ccertain competitors\u201d from the 5G-tender, because \u201cit would do us no good to isolate ourselves\u201d. However, she also acknowledged that such an open policy would have to go hand-in-hand with a thorough vetting of competitors to prevent any threat to national security. To this end, she proposed to establish an EU-agency for screening and monitoring European 5G-components, modelled on the existing European Medicines Agency, which ensures that European standards for drugs within the bloc are being upheld. She has received backing from her party, the conservative CDU: At a party congress on 25 November, CDU adopted the decision not to exclude Huawei, coupled with a ramping up of security standards to ensure that Germany\u2019s 5G-network will be safeguarded from foreign influence. And in an interview with Handelsblatt last Monday, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) warned that a prima facie-exclusion of certain competitors would go against the principles of free-market economy and rule of law, saying: \u201cI am not afraid of China.\u201d (Philipp Grull, EURACTIV.de) /// ROME ROME The potential involvement of Chinese equipment makers Huawei and ZTE in the development of 5G communications networks is creating problems with the US. Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is expected to meet US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the NATO summit in London in order to de-escalate tensions. Last July, the former government adopted emergency legislation to strengthen state powers in supply deals for 5G networks. The so-called golden powers allow Italy to exclude certain companies from public tenders for TLC on the grounds of national interest. Despite the assurances given by Italy, the US yet remains to be convinced. According to the Americans, Chinese penetration in Italy\u2019s 5G network will pose a security threat to the Atlantic Alliance, as it will enable Chinese to subtract sensitive data from the entire NATO communication system. But the US complains are not limited to 5G. Since Italy joined Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, the Trump administration no longer seems confident in the country\u2019s loyalty .

The country\u2019s telecom watchdog ANCOM initially said the auctions would be held by the end of October 2019, and the government hoped to get almost 500 million euros from the sale. But on 31 October, ANCOM\u2019s president Sorin Grindeanu said the auctions were postponed for the first half of 2020. One of the reasons, he said, was the need to implement a recently agreed memorandum of understanding with the USA. In order to implement the memorandum\u2019s provisions, primary legislation needs to be changed, Grindeanu said at that time, explaining the authority must present operators all the costs and restrictions, and it cannot promise this until the legislation is in place. A month later, and after a government change, the legislation changes are yet to be seen. The memorandum signed with the US does not mention any company or a country of origin, but it says that \u201ca rigorous evaluation of vendors\u201d is needed and recommends \u201cthat only trusted and reliable vendors are used in order to protect our networks from unauthorized access or interference.\u201d See the whole MOU here (Bogdan Neagu, EURACTIV.ro). /// BRUSSELS BRUSSELS In Belgium, host country to EU and NATO, cybersecurity officials are rather reluctant to move forward with the rollout of 5G technology due to worries of increased Chinese influence.

It means that soon Huawei\u2019s participation in the construction of 5G network in Poland may be blocked. Poland has been trying to build Ericsson\u2019s production plant in the country for some time. This company has the support of the USA. It is speculated that Poland\u2019s resignation from cooperation with Huawei is a price to pay for the US abolishing visas for Polish citizens. American President Donald Trump signed the decree on this matter on October 4th, which launches the procedure of adding Poland to the Visa Waiver program. Poland has been included in this program since 11 November. It seems that the declarations made in July by President Andrzej Duda \u2013 that Poland will not listen to American demands and will not introduce regulations closing the way for Huawei to participate in the construction of the Polish 5G network \u2013 will not be confirmed. President Duda said so during a meeting in Warsaw with China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

Chinese officials feel confident that Greece will not follow any coalition of countries against Huawei equipment for 5G because China is already a big investor in the country. There is also another reason: two of the three mobile companies in Greece are already using Huawei products in the network. But the US government, on the other hand, has made its position perfectly clear to the Greek authorities. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo and the US ambassador in Greece have been unambiguous: The USA does not want any Chinese equipment in Greece\u2019s 5G market. Senior officials of the Ministry of Digital Governance have told EURACTIV that \u201c5G is not a national issue, but a European one. Greece will decide its road ahead when Europe decides its course\u201d, noting that it will be according to what all member states decide together. An official Greek delegation under PM Mitsotakis visited China a month ago, and telecommunications were on the agenda. \u201cBut 5G and Huawei were not discussed,\u201d a senior government official told EURACTIV. China\u2019s president visited Greece in early November to sign 16 trade and cultural deals between the two governments. While EURACTIV understands that eastern officials pressed also for 5G talks, no deal was signed on the matter and no official meeting with the Ministry of Digital Governance took place.

The same month, Innovation and Technology Minister Laszlo Palkovics said that Hungary had no evidence that equipment from Huawei posed a security threat.

Frequencies in the 3.5 GHz and 3.7 GHz bands, which are suitable for 5G and are currently in the process of allocation in other EU countries, were already allocated by Slovakia in the summer of 2017. Amid discussion about the Chinese interest in building them, Bratislava seems to outsource the security responsibilities to the operators.

{"_id": "15299247059_10157138531972060", "content": "The European Commission is considering measures to impose a temporary ban on facial recognition technologies used by both public and private actors, according to a draft white paper on Artificial Intelligence obtained by EURACTIV. If implemented, the plans could throw current AI projects off course in some EU countries, including Germany\u2019s wish to roll out automatic facial recognition at 134 railway stations and 14 airports. France also has plans to establish a legal framework permitting video surveillance systems to be embedded with facial recognition technologies . The Commission paper, which gives an insight into proposals for a European approach to Artificial Intelligence, stipulates that a future regulatory framework could \u201c include a time \u2013 limited ban on the use of facial recognition technolo g y in public spaces .\u201d The document adds that the \u201c use of facial recognition technology by private or public actors in public spaces would be prohibited for a definite period ( e . g . 3 \u2013 5 years ) during which a sound methodology for assessing the impacts of this technolo g y and possible risk management measures could be identified and developed .\u201d Five Regulatory Options for AI Five Regulatory Options for AI More generally, the draft White Paper, the completed version of which the Commission should publish towards the end of February, features five regulatory options for Artificial Intelligence across the bloc. The different regulatory branches considered by the Commission in the paper are: Voluntary labelling Sectorial requirements for public administration and facial recognition Mandatory risk-based requirements for high-risk applications Safety and liability Governance A Voluntary Labelling framework could consist of a legal instrument whereby developers could \u201c chose to comply , on a voluntary basis , with requirements for ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence.\u201d Should compliance in this area be guaranteed, a \u2018label\u2019 of ethical or trustworthy artificial intelligence would be granted, with binding conditions. Option two focuses on a specific area of public concern \u2013 the use of artificial intelligence by public authorities \u2013 as well as the employment of facial recognition technologies generally. In the former area, the paper states that the EU could adopt an approach akin to the stance taken by Canada in its Directive on Automated Decision Making, which sets out minimum standards for government departments that wish to use an Automated Decision System. As for facial recognition, the Commission document highlights provisions from the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which give citizens \u201cthe right not to be subject of a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling.\u201d In the third area which the Commission is currently priming for regulation, legally binding instruments would apply only \u201c to high \u2013 risk applications of artificial intell i gence. The paper states that \u201ct his risk \u2013 based approach would focus on areas where the public is at risk or an important legal interest is at stake .\u201d Certain sectors which could be considered high risk include healthcare, transport, policing and the judiciary, the document finds. The Commission adds that in order for an application to be considered \u201chigh-risk,\u201d it would have to fulfil one of two criteria: come under the scope of a high-risk sector or present potential legal ramifications and pose \u201cthe risk of injury , death or significant material damage for the individual.\u201d Option four covers safety and liability issues that may arise as part of the future development of Artificial Intelligence and suggests that \u201ctargeted amendments\u201d could be made to EU safety and liability legislation, including on the General Product Safety Directive, the Machinery Directive, the Radio Equipment Directive and the Product Liability Directive. Risks currently not covered in existing legislation, the document says, include \u201cthe  r i sks of cyber threats , risk to personal security , to privacy and to personal data protection,\u201d which may be considered as part of any possible future amendments. On the liability front, \u201c adjustments may be needed to clarify the responsibility of developers of artificial intelligence and to dis tingui sh them from the responsibilities of the producer of the products,\u201d and the scope of legislation could be amended to determine whether artificial intelligence systems should be considered as \u2018products.\u2019 With regards to Option 5, \u2018Governance,\u2019 the Commission says that an effective system of enforcement is essential, requiring a strong system of public oversight with the involvement of national authorities. Promoting cooperation between such national authorities would be necessary, the document notes. The most likely approaches to be adopted formally, the paper notes, are a combination of Options 3, 4, and 5. \u201c The Com mi ssion may consider a combination o f a horizontal instrument setting out transparency and accountability requirements and covering also the governance framework complemented by targeted amendments of existing EU safety and liability legislation,\u201d the document says. Background Background The disclosure of the Commission\u2019s draft white paper follows a period of public discussion on how to deal with the future challenges of Artificial Intelligence. A report published in June by the Commission\u2019s High-Level Group on AI suggested that the EU should consider the need for new regulation to \u201censure adequate protection from adverse impacts\u201d, which could include issues arising from biometric recognition, the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), AI systems built on children\u2019s profiles, and the impact AI may have on fundamental rights. In terms of facial recognition, fears abounded last year about the application of the technology in Europe, with the Swedish Data Protection Authority fining a Swedish Data Protection Authority fining a  municipality \u20ac20,000 for using facial recognition technology in monitoring the attendance of students in school, while France\u2019s data regulator, the CNIL, said the technology breaches GDPR consent rules.

{"_id": "101402598109_10157616369288110", "content": "Governments and tech companies in the bloc and beyond have announced a swath of new measures amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Thailand, people travelling from high-risk areas must download an app so that authorities can monitor their movements during their 14 days of quarantine. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong , the government are using electronic wristbands, QR codes and an app to enforce quarantine. From opt-in apps to digital tracking, countries in Europe have been leveraging technology and data in the battle to curb the spread. This opens up a key question, on how to toe the line between privacy and the need to use data in order to slow down the pandemic. \"Understandably, a lot of these measures are being implemented very quickly,\" Samuel Woodhams, the digital rights expert at internet research firm TOP10VPN, told Euronews. Woodhams has been tracking new measures that are being implemented across the globe. \"They need to be and there is an obvious reason as to why governments are acting so rapidly\". \"But there is also a real issue, because of the speed at which these are being implemented, they are avoiding public and political scrutiny\". Is there a trade-off to be had between privacy and public health? In these unprecedented times, there has been a monumental shift in personal liberties, and there is undoubtedly a trade-off to be had between privacy and the need to curtail the spread of the pandemic, but what measures are appropriate and will they have a long-lasting societal effect? \"That's the million dollar question,\" Woodhams said. \"That is the really difficult thing here - whether these measures are proportionate and necessary at the moment. I think a lot of them are, but I think the major concern is that if they hang about for any longer than they're absolutely necessary then there could be serious repercussions for liberties and human rights\". \"Normally both privacy and public health are a right and have very high status in public policy. The balance between the two is sometimes something that is needed. In particular, it is needed in times of emergency and in times of crisis,\" Professor Andrea Renda, Head of Global Governance, Regulation, Innovation and the Digital Economy at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) think-tank in Brussels told Euronews. Renda detailed the goal of public policy makers, which is to \"protect public health during times of emergency even at the cost of compressing, temporarily, the right to privacy\". This, he said, is \"just a principle\" and depends on the details of plans. That trade also depends on legality. \"Europe is typically a legal system where the right to privacy has been given a very high status - a status of a fundamental right. Whereas in other countries, for example in the United States, this is not necessarily the case, not all the time, and privacy is much more what we would call a property right - something that can be traded and exchanged for something else.\" How are people being tracked in Europe? There has been no pan-European strategy when it comes to digital tracking. However, numerous countries have made moves to introduce tracking measures, or have already done so. According to Woodhams' research , European nations have implemented the most such measures. Poland, for example, is among the countries listed in Woodhams' report. It has released a \"home quarantine\" app , where users send a geolocated picture to the police to prove that they are not violating quarantine. The app is connected to a database of phone numbers of people who are under mandatory quarantine, including those who have arrived back in Poland after being abroad, or people who have been in close contact with someone who contracted the virus. The police can send a text message asking for a picture and if this is not responded to within 20 minutes, another request is sent. Should the user fail to respond, \"it will be a signal to the police that they should check that the quarantine rules are not violated\". By March 23, the first weekend since the app's launch, 10,000 people were using it with 75,000 in the system . Some mobile operators in Europe have agreed to share anonymised data sets with governments in order to track the movements of citizens. In Italy, Vodafone said that \"wherever technically possible, and legally permissible, Vodafone will be willing to assist governments in developing insights based on large anonymised data sets\". According to the company, they are already creating an \"aggregated and anonymous\" heat map showing population movements in Lombardy, similar to those created by Facebook. Facebook has long shared anonymised population data with authorities to assist in times of crisis, from the 2019 Australian wildfires to assisting vaccinations. There has been a rise in physical surveillance, according to Woodhams, with the use of drones in cities such as Brussels and Madrid by the authorities. Meanwhile, doctors and scientists in Kings College London, created a 'Symptom Tracker' app, where people can download the app and detail their symptoms. The aim of this is to help health professionals better understand the symptoms while also identifying high-risk areas in the country. The data, they said, is protected under GDPR and will only be used for \"medical science and to help the NHS\". By March 27, over 1.5 million people had downloaded the app across the country and it will soon be available to download in the United States. Can technology be useful? \"If you use technology in a way that compliments testing, so that you can be more precise in identifying the ones that should be tested because they have been in contact with someone that has tested positive, then this is going to be very helpful,\" said Renda. Technology can't be used as an alternative to testing and contact tracing, however. \"The more we are precise in identifying who should be tested, the better it is. This is where technology can come to the rescue. But technology alone, that is a lesson, is not going to solve anything\". Singapore has been hailed as a success case in keeping the virus relatively at bay, to date. With over 900,000 downloads, Trace Together aims to enhance contact tracing and allow for more targeted testing with citizens volunteering to sign up to the app. It is bluetooth-based, and alters the user when they have been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed case of COVID-19, Woodhams explains. The Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland has announced plans to release a similar type app within the next 10 days that is bluetooth-based and compliant with data protection. However, digital rights lawyers and activists have been vocal about their concern, with one such lawyer calling for a \"data protection impact assessment\" to be made before roll-out. Although contact tracing technology can be helpful, mass surveillance is not necessary to contain the virus, according to Renda. \"But using technology as a compliment to testing, good facilities and availability of medical equipment, that is what is emerging right now as the right policy mix in facing this crisis.\" What about GDPR? These technologies are wide ranging, and whether they are compliant is determined on the type of app and how the data is used. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), has released a statement on processing personal data during the pandemic. In the statement, the board said that \"data protection rules (such as the GDPR) do not hinder measures taken in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic\". Even in exceptional times, however, the board says that personal data should be protected. \"Emergency is a legal condition which may legitimise restrictions of freedoms provided these restrictions are proportionate and limited to the emergency period,\" they said. \"GDPR allows for exceptions in their regulations especially when there are competing public interests,\" Renda explained. The board issued guidance with regards to this, to clarify \"under what conditions there could be exceptions to the full application of GDPR\". If there is a suppression of privacy, this must be both necessary and proportionate . Is there cause for concern? There has not been use of highly intrusive technology within Europe to date, Renda stated. \"But in principle, this could happen depending on what kind of agreements are made between the mobile operators or the large tech platforms and the governments\", he said. \"There is a limit with what you can do with the information once you have collected it. I don't know of any app, currently, at European level that goes beyond those boundaries\". \"I am more concerned by the special powers being implemented in Hungary, for example, so the laws that put the constitutional balance under strain just because of the emergency situation. This has not been translated into a specific technological application as of now, but many European countries are still about to feel the real heat of the virus, meaning that they are far from reaching the peak.\" \"So, the more that this becomes a reality in many European countries, the more one needs to watch out that this does not happen in any of the countries, especially the ones that have a specific temptation to overuse technology and to accumulate more power in the hands of the government,\" he said. In a global context, rights group Privacy International has also raised concerns about the wide-ranging use of technology and the suppression of privacy. They have also been keeping a detailed track of such movements being made. \"When the pandemic is over, such extraordinary measures must be put to an end and held to account,\" they said in a statement . Could we see mass surveillance implemented in certain European countries? \"If it happens, it's not because it was needed,\" Renda said. \"If it happens, it is because it's always attractive from the perspective of a politician, especially the ones that don't live in a very strong democratic context. It is always attractive to use technology to acquire as much information as possible\". \"Technology can be used in preserving very much the privacy of people and it will be extremely useful for us in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. But if, by any chance, mass surveillance develops in Europe, it will not have been for the coronavirus. The coronavirus will have been an excuse for this to happen\".

Woodhams has been tracking new measures that are being implemented across the globe. \"They need to be and there is an obvious reason as to why governments are acting so rapidly\". \"But there is also a real issue, because of the speed at which these are being implemented, they are avoiding public and political scrutiny\". Is there a trade-off to be had between privacy and public health? In these unprecedented times, there has been a monumental shift in personal liberties, and there is undoubtedly a trade-off to be had between privacy and the need to curtail the spread of the pandemic, but what measures are appropriate and will they have a long-lasting societal effect? \"That's the million dollar question,\" Woodhams said. \"That is the really difficult thing here - whether these measures are proportionate and necessary at the moment. I think a lot of them are, but I think the major concern is that if they hang about for any longer than they're absolutely necessary then there could be serious repercussions for liberties and human rights\". \"Normally both privacy and public health are a right and have very high status in public policy. The balance between the two is sometimes something that is needed. In particular, it is needed in times of emergency and in times of crisis,\" Professor Andrea Renda, Head of Global Governance, Regulation, Innovation and the Digital Economy at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) think-tank in Brussels told Euronews. Renda detailed the goal of public policy makers, which is to \"protect public health during times of emergency even at the cost of compressing, temporarily, the right to privacy\". This, he said, is \"just a principle\" and depends on the details of plans. That trade also depends on legality. \"Europe is typically a legal system where the right to privacy has been given a very high status - a status of a fundamental right. Whereas in other countries, for example in the United States, this is not necessarily the case, not all the time, and privacy is much more what we would call a property right - something that can be traded and exchanged for something else.\" How are people being tracked in Europe? There has been no pan-European strategy when it comes to digital tracking. However, numerous countries have made moves to introduce tracking measures, or have already done so. According to Woodhams' research , European nations have implemented the most such measures. Poland, for example, is among the countries listed in Woodhams' report. It has released a \"home quarantine\" app , where users send a geolocated picture to the police to prove that they are not violating quarantine. The app is connected to a database of phone numbers of people who are under mandatory quarantine, including those who have arrived back in Poland after being abroad, or people who have been in close contact with someone who contracted the virus. The police can send a text message asking for a picture and if this is not responded to within 20 minutes, another request is sent. Should the user fail to respond, \"it will be a signal to the police that they should check that the quarantine rules are not violated\". By March 23, the first weekend since the app's launch, 10,000 people were using it with 75,000 in the system . Some mobile operators in Europe have agreed to share anonymised data sets with governments in order to track the movements of citizens. In Italy, Vodafone said that \"wherever technically possible, and legally permissible, Vodafone will be willing to assist governments in developing insights based on large anonymised data sets\". According to the company, they are already creating an \"aggregated and anonymous\" heat map showing population movements in Lombardy, similar to those created by Facebook. Facebook has long shared anonymised population data with authorities to assist in times of crisis, from the 2019 Australian wildfires to assisting vaccinations. There has been a rise in physical surveillance, according to Woodhams, with the use of drones in cities such as Brussels and Madrid by the authorities. Meanwhile, doctors and scientists in Kings College London, created a 'Symptom Tracker' app, where people can download the app and detail their symptoms. The aim of this is to help health professionals better understand the symptoms while also identifying high-risk areas in the country. The data, they said, is protected under GDPR and will only be used for \"medical science and to help the NHS\". By March 27, over 1.5 million people had downloaded the app across the country and it will soon be available to download in the United States. Can technology be useful? \"If you use technology in a way that compliments testing, so that you can be more precise in identifying the ones that should be tested because they have been in contact with someone that has tested positive, then this is going to be very helpful,\" said Renda. Technology can't be used as an alternative to testing and contact tracing, however. \"The more we are precise in identifying who should be tested, the better it is. This is where technology can come to the rescue. But technology alone, that is a lesson, is not going to solve anything\". Singapore has been hailed as a success case in keeping the virus relatively at bay, to date. With over 900,000 downloads, Trace Together aims to enhance contact tracing and allow for more targeted testing with citizens volunteering to sign up to the app. It is bluetooth-based, and alters the user when they have been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed case of COVID-19, Woodhams explains. The Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland has announced plans to release a similar type app within the next 10 days that is bluetooth-based and compliant with data protection. However, digital rights lawyers and activists have been vocal about their concern, with one such lawyer calling for a \"data protection impact assessment\" to be made before roll-out. Although contact tracing technology can be helpful, mass surveillance is not necessary to contain the virus, according to Renda. \"But using technology as a compliment to testing, good facilities and availability of medical equipment, that is what is emerging right now as the right policy mix in facing this crisis.\" What about GDPR? These technologies are wide ranging, and whether they are compliant is determined on the type of app and how the data is used. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), has released a statement on processing personal data during the pandemic. In the statement, the board said that \"data protection rules (such as the GDPR) do not hinder measures taken in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic\". Even in exceptional times, however, the board says that personal data should be protected. \"Emergency is a legal condition which may legitimise restrictions of freedoms provided these restrictions are proportionate and limited to the emergency period,\" they said. \"GDPR allows for exceptions in their regulations especially when there are competing public interests,\" Renda explained. The board issued guidance with regards to this, to clarify \"under what conditions there could be exceptions to the full application of GDPR\". If there is a suppression of privacy, this must be both necessary and proportionate . Is there cause for concern? There has not been use of highly intrusive technology within Europe to date, Renda stated. \"But in principle, this could happen depending on what kind of agreements are made between the mobile operators or the large tech platforms and the governments\", he said. \"There is a limit with what you can do with the information once you have collected it. I don't know of any app, currently, at European level that goes beyond those boundaries\". \"I am more concerned by the special powers being implemented in Hungary, for example, so the laws that put the constitutional balance under strain just because of the emergency situation. This has not been translated into a specific technological application as of now, but many European countries are still about to feel the real heat of the virus, meaning that they are far from reaching the peak.\" \"So, the more that this becomes a reality in many European countries, the more one needs to watch out that this does not happen in any of the countries, especially the ones that have a specific temptation to overuse technology and to accumulate more power in the hands of the government,\" he said. In a global context, rights group Privacy International has also raised concerns about the wide-ranging use of technology and the suppression of privacy. They have also been keeping a detailed track of such movements being made. \"When the pandemic is over, such extraordinary measures must be put to an end and held to account,\" they said in a statement . Could we see mass surveillance implemented in certain European countries? \"If it happens, it's not because it was needed,\" Renda said. \"If it happens, it is because it's always attractive from the perspective of a politician, especially the ones that don't live in a very strong democratic context. It is always attractive to use technology to acquire as much information as possible\". \"Technology can be used in preserving very much the privacy of people and it will be extremely useful for us in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. But if, by any chance, mass surveillance develops in Europe, it will not have been for the coronavirus. The coronavirus will have been an excuse for this to happen\". Governments and tech companies in the bloc and beyond have announced a swath of new measures amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Thailand, people travelling from high-risk areas must download an app so that authorities can monitor their movements during their 14 days of quarantine. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong , the government are using electronic wristbands, QR codes and an app to enforce quarantine. From opt-in apps to digital tracking, countries in Europe have been leveraging technology and data in the battle to curb the spread. This opens up a key question, on how to toe the line between privacy and the need to use data in order to slow down the pandemic. \"Understandably, a lot of these measures are being implemented very quickly,\" Samuel Woodhams, the digital rights expert at internet research firm TOP10VPN, told Euronews.

The Metropolitan Police said the deployment \u2014 from Friday \u2014 would help the force tackle \"serious crime\" and stressed it would not replace \"traditional policing\". It insisted live facial recognition (LFR) technology would be clearly signposted and implemented at specific locations where it believes the most serious offenders would be seen. \"Every day, our police officers are briefed about suspects they should look out for; LFR improves the effectiveness of this tactic,\" a statement from the Met's assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave said. He added: \"Similarly if it can help locate missing children or vulnerable adults swiftly, and keep them from harm and exploitation, then we have a duty to deploy the technology to do this.\" READ MORE: Live facial recognition technology has long been a controversial topic in the UK and in wider Europe. Earlier this week, leaked EU documents revealed the bloc had been considering a temporary ban on the technology - a move that has been backed by Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet. It came after years of hotly-contested trials in several member states, whom, like the Met, wanted to test whether such technology could help combat crime. In Germany, police in Hamburg trialled facial recognition during the 2017 G20 summit. This was later found to be in violation of data protection laws. Another test was also run on hundreds of volunteers at Berlin's S\u00fcdkreuz station, which was met with criticism the technology could glean further information from a subject than it originally let on. In France, police in Nice have also used live facial recognition as a trial at the city's carnival. A case in Sweden saw a municipality fined \u20ac20,000 after it was discovered a school had been using facial recognition to track students' attendance. So - how does it work? Put simply, the system will examine your face and compare it to a database of images of people wanted by police. It will analyse the structure of your face by measuring the distance between your eyes, nose, mouth and jaw, and will create a biometric map somewhat unique to you. This map will then be compared with the database of pictures to see if you are a match. Why is there a problem with this? Aside from the human rights implications, the technology itself has been widely reported to be inaccurate. In July last year, an independent report obtained by Sky News found that 81% of people flagged by the technology were innocent. This false identifying was found to be particularly prevalent among black people and minority ethnic groups. The British Institute for Human Rights went further to question how much this knowledge of heightened surveillance would affect normal behaviour. \"Knowing that we are being watched in public spaces may lead us to change our behaviour, we might not attend protests or express our feelings in the same way,\" he said. \"This infringes on our freedom of expression.\" It also asked what would happen to this biometric map after it is taken, even if you're not a match on the database? What has been the reaction to today's announcement? The Metropolitan Police maintains the rollout \"strikes the balance\" between using technology to stop criminals while also respecting privacy and human rights. But rights groups across the country are not so sure. Liberty Human Rights group's advocacy director Clare Collier told Euronews in an email the move was \"dangerous, oppressive and completely unjustified\" and put the UK on course to become a \"surveillance state\". She said: \"Facial recognition technology gives the state unprecedented power to track and monitor any one of us, destroying our privacy and our free expression. \"Rolling out an oppressive mass surveillance tool that has been rejected by democracies and embraced by oppressive regimes is a dangerous and sinister step, pushing us towards a surveillance state in which our freedom to live our lives free from state interference no longer exists.\" Liberty, which has long campaigned against the technology, has an ongoing petition of which it says 21,000 people have signed in favour of a ban. Meanwhile, Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties and privacy campaigning group, said the move posed a \"serious threat\" to civil liberties in the UK.

Today the city is betting on the use of 5G to build a new future for itself. The Chinese company ZTE \u2014 a leading provider of communication products and services \u2014 has chosen L'Aquila to open its first 5G innovation and research centre. ZTE and the University of L\u2019Aquila are testing the technology to better manage earthquake-related emergencies. Using 5G, the alert can be sent out at a faster speed. \u201cWe imagine a building that is located close to the epicentre of the earthquake. We are able to intercept the tremor and thanks to 5G technology we can then send an alert to L\u2019Aquila - eight seconds earlier than the actual arrival of the seismic wave\u201d Fabio Graziosi, professor of telecommunications engineering at the University of L\u2019Aquila, told Euronews. It\u2019s not just about earthquakes. In the smart city of the future, researchers are looking at ways to use this technology to provide services in different fields, including the arts. L\u2019Aquila\u2019s aim is to become a \"Living Lab\" where the technology can be used to provide services in different fields. In the ZTE's innovation labm researchers are testing the use of 5G in six sectors, earthquakes, the arts, mobility, health, agriculture, security. Pierluigi Biondi, the Mayor of L'Aquila, is among those convinced that the city will become a model. \u201cWe have to imagine 5G as the future mainly in terms of services it can provide and its daily use. From this point of view, L\u2019Aquila needs to offer powerful solutions when faced with new requirements that come as a consequence of the earthquake. And by doing so it can offer a protocol that can be replicated,\u201d says Biondi. But not everyone in L\u2019Aquila supports the research. They fear the potential risks for both the environment and people\u2019s health. Italian Stop5G Alliance spokesperson, Maurizio Martucci has a different take on the issue. He sees the widespread use of the technology as what he calls a \u201charmful weapon\u201d and he is determined to bring his battle against 5G to Europe. \u201cThere are so many people who are already sick - who are suffering from exposure to radiation. So we demand that national governments and the European Parliament stop this technology because the use of millimetre waves for 5G hasn't been tested yet and we don\u2019t know what will happen when people are exposed to radiations.\u201d The Italian government recently voted to strengthen state powers to intervene in the development of 5G services that would apply to non-EU companies. A move that some believe could delay the rollout of 5G mobile services in the country.

We are able to intercept the tremor and thanks to 5G technology we can then send an alert to L\u2019Aquila - eight seconds earlier than the actual arrival of the seismic wave\u201d Fabio Graziosi, professor of telecommunications engineering at the University of L\u2019Aquila, told Euronews. It\u2019s not just about earthquakes. In the smart city of the future, researchers are looking at ways to use this technology to provide services in different fields, including the arts. L\u2019Aquila\u2019s aim is to become a \"Living Lab\" where the technology can be used to provide services in different fields. In the ZTE's innovation labm researchers are testing the use of 5G in six sectors, earthquakes, the arts, mobility, health, agriculture, security. Pierluigi Biondi, the Mayor of L'Aquila, is among those convinced that the city will become a model. \u201cWe have to imagine 5G as the future mainly in terms of services it can provide and its daily use. From this point of view, L\u2019Aquila needs to offer powerful solutions when faced with new requirements that come as a consequence of the earthquake. And by doing so it can offer a protocol that can be replicated,\u201d says Biondi. But not everyone in L\u2019Aquila supports the research. They fear the potential risks for both the environment and people\u2019s health. Italian Stop5G Alliance spokesperson, Maurizio Martucci has a different take on the issue. He sees the widespread use of the technology as what he calls a \u201charmful weapon\u201d and he is determined to bring his battle against 5G to Europe. \u201cThere are so many people who are already sick - who are suffering from exposure to radiation. So we demand that national governments and the European Parliament stop this technology because the use of millimetre waves for 5G hasn't been tested yet and we don\u2019t know what will happen when people are exposed to radiations.\u201d The Italian government recently voted to strengthen state powers to intervene in the development of 5G services that would apply to non-EU companies. A move that some believe could delay the rollout of 5G mobile services in the country. If you look at L\u2019Aquila from a distance, the city is surrounded by cranes, the signs of one of the worst earthquakes in Italy's history . Today the city is betting on the use of 5G to build a new future for itself. The Chinese company ZTE \u2014 a leading provider of communication products and services \u2014 has chosen L'Aquila to open its first 5G innovation and research centre.

A bar in central London has become the first in the world to install new AI-powered facial recognition tech to help staff see who's next in line. Developed by British AI firm DataSparQ, the system identifies people waiting at the bar, displays their place in the queue and shows their estimated wait time. DataSparQ announced it had developed the \"AI Bar\" tech back in July, this is its first installation. \"There's a big screen behind the bar, the webcam captures footage of everyone coming to queue behind a bar, based on a first come, first serve basis,\" explains DataSparQ managing director John Wyllie. \"Those who've been waiting first get a number above your head to say you're number one in the queue. Those who've been waiting least time are at the back of the queue.\" The aim is to eliminate queue jumping and make ordering drinks faster, fairer and less intimidating. The AI system also assists ID checks, by suggesting if a customer looks under 25-years-old. An additional \"FaceTab\" feature is being developed, which will let customers link their bar tab to their face, so no-one else can put drinks on their tab. \"Some people probably enjoy playing the game, and if they're good at it and are able to barge their way to the front of the queue this probably is not for them,\" says Wyllie. \"But I think there are a lot of people who are too shy or too small or just don't catch the attention of the bartender's eye, for them it just brings some extra fairness.\" Sammy Forway, owner of The Underdog, near London Bridge, hopes the tech will help bar staff be more efficient. The data generated, including orders per-hour and average wait time, can also help the bar improve its service. \"We're very good at queuing in the UK, but certainly not when are getting a drink,\" says Forway. \"So, everyone wants to come, get served first. So, although our team's trained well, if they're turning round and serving, it's difficult for them to see exactly who's next. So, this technology, it's been helping them, be exact on who's at the bar and who's next in line to be served.\" It might be good news for those who struggle to get served in busy bars, but privacy campaigners warn it \"trivialises a dangerous surveillance technology.\" \"It's not solving a problem that desperately needs to be solved at all, there's no obvious need for it. And yet people just going to have a drink are going to be biometrically analysed, scanned, have their face up on a screen, it's just really quite intrusive stuff,\" says Silkie Carlo, director of British civil liberties campaign organisation Big Brother Watch. \"And around the rest of the world, we're seeing that facial recognition is being used as quite an oppressive surveillance technology, so what we don't want to see is it sort of creeping into social life in the UK.\" Wyllie says bar visitors shouldn't be worried about their privacy - data collected by the webcam isn't stored, snap-shot thumbnail images of faces are deleted at the end of each session. The data doesn't leave the venue. It's processed internally by the AI device. \"We're being very transparent around how we're using your face for this purpose,\" says Wyllie. \"There's no hidden cameras, there's no data being stored in any permanent way. \"And so, we're really keen to understand what the public feel is appropriate and what level of consent and permission is required to allow us to do this.\" The Underdog hopes to use the technology at peak times. But, due to GDPR standards, they must obtain explicit consent from everyone entering the venue in order to use the tech, so currently it is only used for special events when consent has been obtained.

The app they are using, FaceApp, has been enjoying a boost in popularity this week and counts celebrities such as Drake and Gordon Ramsey among its 80 million users. This week, it overtook Instagram and Whatsapp on the Apple App Store's top chart as the most downloaded app, prompting CEO Yaroslav Goncharov to post on Facebook: \"Change, it's nice.\" But many users on social media have raised concerns surrounding privacy and facial recognition \u2014 do these concerns have any basis? What is FaceApp? FaceApp was founded in 2017 by Wireless Lab, a company based in St Petersburg, Russia. That year, the app was widely criticized for \u201cracist\u201d selfie filters; an option labelled as \u201chot\u201d seemingly lightened users\u2019 skin tones.

Stockholm\u2019s Mayor Anna K\u00f6nig Jerlmyr outlined the city\u2019s ambitious climate goals at a conference of the European GrowSmarter project . She told Futuris: \u201cWe are developing a new technique with carbon capture storage. And we think that with this new technique, combined with our district heating systems that are fossil fuel-free today, we can create a climate positive city. The first in the world by 2040.\" The Valla torg district is one such example of the efforts being made. As part of the GrowSmarter project, public apartments have been refurbished to reduce their climate impact. There are electric cars and bicycle-sharing schemes as well as a new kind of waste management system. High-pressure tubes underground transport the waste to a single collection centre, meaning less space is needed, and fewer garbage trucks on the road. Each type of rubbish bag has a different colour and an optical sensor and weighing scales allow individual processing of waste. Patrick Haraldsson, the North Europe President of waste collection company Envac, says the high-tech system allows residents to get instant feedback on their mobile phones. They are informed about how much waste they are creating and how much biogas it will produce. In the future, the system could be used to charge residents based on how much waste they create. Sustainable urban mobility is another priority of the Swedish capital, which recently installed sensors near the city\u2019s stadium. They collect a large variety of data, aimed at helping the city to implement a more efficient transport policy. Stanley Ekberg, IBM\u2019s Client Executive in Sweden, told Futuris: \u201cHistorically, you have been waiting for one or two years to get the data. Now, you get near-time data, only 15 minutes old. So if you have taken a decision and implemented something, you get instant feedback on the results. So this is very good.\u201d For Stockholm, reducing emissions also means tackling energy waste, such as the heat produced by the many data centres based in the city. The Glesys data storage company feeds into the district heating system, thanks to a heat pump facility financed as part of the Growsmarter project. Glesys manager Joakim Jarstorp says it means a greener data centre. \u201cInstead of wasting the heat into the air, we also get money back from the district heating company, because they buy our heat.\u201d In 2019, the district heating network was able to heat 30,000 apartments, not only thanks to the heat recovered from the Glesys data centre, but also from supermarkets, and even crematoriums. \"The internet could heat most of the 140,000 new apartments expected to be built in Stockholm by 2030\", according to Mika Hakosalo, who is leading the implementation of the smart solutions in Stockholm. Martin Brolin, of Stockholm Exergi, says the company hopes to expand its network of heat exchange systems. The GrowSmarter project has listed 12 smart solutions related to energy, mobility and infrastructure that are being rolled out in Stockholm and two other \u201clighthouse cities\u201d - Barcelona and Cologne. Some of these solutions may soon be implemented in other European cities, such as Porto, Valetta and Cork.

In this episode of Real Economy the team look at what Europe is doing to help foster the continent's innovative industries, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics. Once home to great minds like Averroes, today Seville continues to look to the future. At the city's Center for Advanced Aerospace Technologies (CATEC) scientists are working out how to develop new technologies such as autonomous drones that have arms capable of inspecting hard to reach pipelines and industrial plants. \"One of the main advantages (of this technology) is that humans can be seated on the ground, controlling the drone remotely, and they are not at risk of being high. And, the other one of course, is that we are able, in certain conditions, to perform this operation faster than the traditional methods,\" says Miguel \u00c1ngel Trujillo Soto, the head of CATEC's autonomous systems unit. The drone technology was developed as part of a partnership with the University of Seville and the European Commission. The project was set up in a bid to boost both European research into AI and find future, real world, applications for such technology. Investing in innovation Currently, EU companies spend less on innovation than Asia and the US. In 2016, Europe's private investment in AI stood at \u20ac2.4-3.2 billion, compared to \u20ac6.5-9.7 billion in Asia and \u20ac12.1-18.6 billion in North America. A declaration of cooperation on artificial intelligence signed by European countries in April 2018, aims to change that trend. The declaration stated that the EU would increase investment in AI research and innovation in both the public and private sectors by the end of 2020. That should see \u20ac1.5 billion for the period 2018-2020 under the Horizon research and innovation programme, plus \u20ac20 billion of combined public and private investment. However, to establish a solid base for AI in the future, more investment will be needed after 2020. Consequently, \u20ac20 billion per year of combined public and private investment will be set aside and \u20ac1 billion annually through Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programme. Sweden tops Europe's innovation table Given that around two-thirds of Europe's economic growth over the last few decades has been driven by innovation, it is not hard to see why European policymakers and governments are making such investment commitments. Sweden currently tops the table when it comes to Europe's most innovative countries. Real Economy's Sasha Vakulina went to Stockholm to meet Dora Palfi, the co-founder a CEO of 'imagiLabs' which creates tech programming tools for teenage girls, bringing coding to smartphones. Sasha Vakulina: \"Sweden is the EU innovation leader. What do you think makes this country so attractive for businesses and startups like yours?\" Dora Palfi: \"I think the whole ecosystem. Supporting individuals with ideas is what makes Sweden really an innovation hub. I think also the whole mindset in Sweden is very entrepreneurial. There is a lot of collaboration between small companies and also large organisations, and there is also a lot of collaboration with governmental projects, so we recently received a grant from VINNOVA - the Swedish government agency.\" Sasha Vakulina: \"How important is education for innovation and for boosting the innovative economy?\" Dora Palfi: \"Education, I think, is where it all begins, really. So that is a basis for it all. And, there are many reasons, but one particular thing is that many people would think that innovation means somehow being like a genius, you know, just coming up with a great idea. But really, in reality, it is being able to combine available knowledge and things that maybe work in one context and applying them in a really smart way into another context.\" Sasha Vakulina: \"When it comes to the tech sector women make up !\" Dora Palfi: \"I truly believe that technology is the future, I think a lot of us do. From that, it kind of logically follows that if women are not as actively involved in technology as men are \u2013 that women do not have equal terms to contribute to the future, and that is something I really want to change. I think we need more women who have a technical background in order to be able to shape the future of tech and businesses, and to be able to innovate in that end.\" Innovation is vital when it comes to creating economic growth.

The drone technology was developed as part of a partnership with the University of Seville and the European Commission. The project was set up in a bid to boost both European research into AI and find future, real world, applications for such technology. Investing in innovation Currently, EU companies spend less on innovation than Asia and the US. In 2016, Europe's private investment in AI stood at \u20ac2.4-3.2 billion, compared to \u20ac6.5-9.7 billion in Asia and \u20ac12.1-18.6 billion in North America. A declaration of cooperation on artificial intelligence signed by European countries in April 2018, aims to change that trend. The declaration stated that the EU would increase investment in AI research and innovation in both the public and private sectors by the end of 2020. That should see \u20ac1.5 billion for the period 2018-2020 under the Horizon research and innovation programme, plus \u20ac20 billion of combined public and private investment. However, to establish a solid base for AI in the future, more investment will be needed after 2020. Consequently, \u20ac20 billion per year of combined public and private investment will be set aside and \u20ac1 billion annually through Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programme. Sweden tops Europe's innovation table Given that around two-thirds of Europe's economic growth over the last few decades has been driven by innovation, it is not hard to see why European policymakers and governments are making such investment commitments. Sweden currently tops the table when it comes to Europe's most innovative countries. Real Economy's Sasha Vakulina went to Stockholm to meet Dora Palfi, the co-founder a CEO of 'imagiLabs' which creates tech programming tools for teenage girls, bringing coding to smartphones. Sasha Vakulina: \"Sweden is the EU innovation leader. What do you think makes this country so attractive for businesses and startups like yours?\" Dora Palfi: \"I think the whole ecosystem. Supporting individuals with ideas is what makes Sweden really an innovation hub. I think also the whole mindset in Sweden is very entrepreneurial. There is a lot of collaboration between small companies and also large organisations, and there is also a lot of collaboration with governmental projects, so we recently received a grant from VINNOVA - the Swedish government agency.\" Sasha Vakulina: \"How important is education for innovation and for boosting the innovative economy?\" Dora Palfi: \"Education, I think, is where it all begins, really. So that is a basis for it all. And, there are many reasons, but one particular thing is that many people would think that innovation means somehow being like a genius, you know, just coming up with a great idea. But really, in reality, it is being able to combine available knowledge and things that maybe work in one context and applying them in a really smart way into another context.\" Sasha Vakulina: \"When it comes to the tech sector women make up !\" Dora Palfi: \"I truly believe that technology is the future, I think a lot of us do. From that, it kind of logically follows that if women are not as actively involved in technology as men are \u2013 that women do not have equal terms to contribute to the future, and that is something I really want to change. I think we need more women who have a technical background in order to be able to shape the future of tech and businesses, and to be able to innovate in that end.\"", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "Innovation: Europe's road to growth"}

Not only are they wrong, but their thinking endangers us all. It\u2019s the same logic that led to the Cold War, the nuclear arms race and the Doomsday Clock. I quit my job at a young, promising tech company in January in protest precisely because I was concerned about how the Pentagon might use AI in warfare and how the business I was part of might contribute to it. I have seen close up the perils of this unreliable but powerful technology, and I have since joined the International Committee for Robot Arms Control (ICRAC) and the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots to make sure that AI is used responsibly, even in cases of war. It was because of this protest and my objection to autonomous weaponry that I attended the U.N. conference as part of the campaign\u2019s delegation. With Russia actively seeking to derail international negotiations to regulate Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems , or LAWS, and China churning out ever-improving AI-powered drones , the fears of these two countries\u2019 potential use of killer robots are understandable. But the best way to deal with it isn\u2019t for the U.S. to propel the killer robot arms race by building bigger, faster, deadlier machines of our own. It\u2019s to cut it short. We\u2019ve been down the path of escalation before , and we can be smarter this time around. Today, we should put in place international laws under the strict enforcement of the U.N. that ban the development of these systems and condemn their use globally. If our goal is the easing of worldwide tensions, and we want Russia and China to adhere to the ban, we can achieve this by limiting the military advantages of this technology. That will make it less appealing for adversaries to pursue \u2014 and less worth the price they\u2019ll pay for being outside the bounds of an international accord. The technical limitations of LAWS provide a clear opportunity for keeping the lid shut on this Pandora\u2019s box: We should devote our considerable hi-tech R&D minds and resources into developing robust countermeasures rather than offensive ones. If our enemies build Terminators, we can fight like John Connor , who valiantly defended humankind in the rebellion against its would-be Terminator overlords. What makes me so confident that the John Connor route is viable? Before I left my job as head of data operations at the AI startup Clarifai, I saw firsthand the many spectacular and unpredictable ways that AI can fail. It was my job to find image data that would fill the gaps to improve performance in the computer vision models we built. For every mistake we could correct by adding more photos to the data set, a new, unexpected issue would arise. It\u2019s a little like cooking without a recipe \u2014 if that recipe were brand new, there were millions of ingredients, and someone forgot to label all the jars. AI models are, by definition, predictive technology. They can only predict objects very similar to the objects they\u2019ve previously seen, and it\u2019s impossible to cover every potential scenario that a model might encounter. The camera angle, light, proximity to objects, camera quality and weather conditions are just some of the factors that affect the accuracy of a computer model trying to identify its target. This is what researchers mean when they call such models \u201cbrittle\u201d: They tend to crack when faced with a scenario slightly different from the conditions introduced during the model\u2019s construction. This is doubly true when talking about warfare, since battlefield conditions are rarely predictable, and the enemy will always try to find a way to exploit this weakness. In fact, there is an entire field of research dedicated to fooling AI models for computer vision \u2014 the very models the Pentagon would need to install in killer robots so they can aim at targets. To date, no computer vision model has proved bulletproof against the exploits researchers call \u201cadversarial attacks,\u201d something akin to hacking to purposely fool the computer vision program. In World War II, we used chaff (a cloud of thin pieces of aluminum) to prevent enemy radar from targeting our airplanes. That same principle can be applied to adversarial attacks against killer robots. In the analogous case for AI, images with a little \u201c noise \u201d (static or some other pixel-based disturbance) added to the photo have been shown to defeat AI vision models \u2014 even if the image looks fine to a human eye. So picture a platoon of tanks riding under a netting of multicolored, reflective confetti or something equally out of place. If the robots haven\u2019t been trained to deal with that, the soldiers underneath will be practically invisible. Research also suggests that it\u2019s not shape or color but texture that allows AI vision models to lock onto a given object before it launches an attack. If the Terminator is looking for skin, let\u2019s bring fur to the battle. If it\u2019s programmed to expect sand, litter the battlefield with purple AstroTurf. If we want to get sophisticated, let\u2019s invent a living, mutable camouflage that morphs into generative patterns and textures. Or equip our troops with unexpected objects , like, say, pink inflatable porcupines affixed to armored vehicles. Because those objects don\u2019t resemble anything that was used to train the targeting algorithm, the computer will assume the humans it sees are somehow different from those it was trained to kill.

But researchers beg to differ. Taken on their own, contact tracing apps such as those currently being developed across Europe will have limited impact on the spread of coronavirus and could even give people a false sense of security, according to computer scientists and experts in artificial intelligence. \u201cTechnology is never a silver bullet and it\u2019s particularly not a silver bullet in this circumstance,\u201d Carly Kind, director of AI research center Ada Lovelace Institute, told POLITICO. \u201cBut it\u2019s often being framed as a silver bullet \u2014 and that\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d Her warning comes as European governments from Berlin to Valletta are racing to roll out contact-tracing apps that analyze signals between mobile phones to alert people who have been close enough to infect each other. Widespread downloading of such apps, they hope, will help to track the virus' spread and ease the lifting of lockdowns. But while such plans have prompted a fiery discussion among Europe's privacy regulators, little attention has centered on the effectiveness of apps in stopping the pandemic. Tech experts harbor serious doubts. In an analysis released this week, the London-based Ada Lovelace Institute warned about what it described as a lack of evidence that apps help to curb the spread of the virus, urging the government to shelve plans for a U.K. contact tracing app. Researchers across Europe are striking similar notes, warning that apps alone will not on their own allow countries to fully resume public life. That stage will only be reached when a vaccine is deployed, they say. Back to square one \u201cUsing a track-and-tracing app might be something that helps, but it\u2019s not \u2014 as a lot of people now think \u2014 a catch-all solution that allows you to lift all the restrictions and we\u2019re done,\u201d said Frank Dignum, a professor of socially-aware artificial intelligence at Ume\u00e5 University in Sweden. Along with a team of two dozen AI researchers, Dignum has built a computer model that can simulate the consequences of policy measures to curb the coronavirus. When they used the model to test the effectiveness of contact-tracing apps, the results suggested that they are far less effective than often claimed. For example, they found out that it will require far more than 60 percent of the population to download the app \u2014 an oft-quoted magical threshold \u2014 in order for them to be effective. A key reason, they said, is that most of the people downloading the app will be people avoiding infection rather than those at particular risk of contracting the virus. Any rollout of contact-tracing apps would also have to be paired with mass testing. !function(e,t,i,n,r,d){function o(e,i,n,r){t[s].list.push({id:e,title:r,container:i,type:n})}var a=\"script\",s=\"InfogramEmbeds\",c=e.getElementsByTagName(a),l=c[0];if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&&0===t.location.protocol.indexOf(\"file\")&&(i=\"http:\"+i),!t[s]){t[s]={script:i,list:[]};var m=e.createElement(a);m.async=1,m.src=i,l.parentNode.insertBefore(m,l)}t[s].add=o;var p=c[c.length-1],f=e.createElement(\"div\");p.parentNode.insertBefore(f,p),t[s].add(n,f,r,d)}(document,window,\"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",\"f5c56773-311a-4433-898e-ce230740ac91\",\"interactive\",\"\"); When Dignum's team ran the simulation for his home country, the Netherlands, he noticed that a contact-tracing app scheme would have to be paired with more than 100,000 daily tests \u2014 far more than the current number. Failing that, all those who have potentially been in contact with infected individuals would have to go back into self-isolation. \u201cWithin one or two weeks, you would have one to two million people sitting at home again,\u201d he said. This prompted Dignum last week to co-sign an open letter along with 130 other researchers from the Netherlands urging Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s government to assess how useful and effective such apps are before rolling them out. A potentially deadly dilemma After countries across Europe imposed unprecedented measures to restrict movement, statistics suggest that lockdowns have helped to flatten the curve of new infections. The good news, however, means that decision-makers face a tough dilemma over what to do next. While they are under pressure to lift at least parts of the lockdowns due to economic and other concerns, they worry this will lead to another wave of new infections with potentially even more devastating consequences. To prevent that, decision-makers from the U.K. to France have increasingly been promoting the use of digital tools, ranging from \" immunity passports ,\" proving that someone has immunity from contracting the virus, to e-health applications allowing patients to assess their symptoms remotely. But no technology has gained as much traction as contact-tracing apps, which are supposed to help countries prevent large-scale outbreaks before they happen. The experience of countries such as Taiwan or South Korea suggest that such measures may be effective \u2014 if paired with mass testing. Kind warned that \"people try to boil that success down to the use of one a single technological measure such as contact-tracing \u2014 when, in fact, technology \u2026 was embedded in a set of policy and strategic decisions such as widespread testing or temperature-taking.\" \"And you can\u2019t separate the success of the technology from the policies,\u201d she added. Experts also warn that the underlying technology, which analyzes Bluetooth signals, is prone to errors: In cities, for example, next-door neighbors who have never met could end up being alerted about each other's infections even if walls between them make contracting the virus impossible. Such \u201cfalse positives,\u201d particularly once their number grows, could make people increasingly indifferent to being alerted about potential contacts with others who are infected. Finally, it is far from certain that European governments can convince enough citizens to use the voluntary apps. While surveys from places like the U.K. suggest that a majority of citizens support the schemes, people in other countries such as Germany are more skeptical . And even in Singapore, where three out of four citizens say they trust their government with their data, only about 1.1 million of 5.4 million citizens have so far signed up for the country\u2019s voluntary scheme \u2014 far below a 75 percent threshold authorities in the country have said is necessary for it to be effective. !function(e,t,i,n,r,d){function o(e,i,n,r){t[s].list.push({id:e,title:r,container:i,type:n})}var a=\"script\",s=\"InfogramEmbeds\",c=e.getElementsByTagName(a),l=c[0];if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&&0===t.location.protocol.indexOf(\"file\")&&(i=\"http:\"+i),!t[s]){t[s]={script:i,list:[]};var m=e.createElement(a);m.async=1,m.src=i,l.parentNode.insertBefore(m,l)}t[s].add=o;var p=c[c.length-1],f=e.createElement(\"div\");p.parentNode.insertBefore(f,p),t[s].add(n,f,r,d)}(document,window,\"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",\"633de1e6-df9d-4732-b835-41f151fb9a19\",\"interactive\",\"\");", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "Coronavirus: Actually, we don\u2019t have an app for that"}
{"_id": "587266261407195_1960286620771812", "content": "Governments are betting on coronavirus tracking apps to help ease lockdown restrictions. Too bad the techies developing these tools have turned on one another. At first glance, the spat seems charmingly geeky \u2014 developers who favor so-called decentralized design for the apps, with data stored on devices, disagree with other developers who back a centralized design where data gets stored on the cloud. But for those involved, the choice is ultra-serious and has far-reaching consequences for privacy and Europe's technological independence. It's already prompted a series of defections from a high-profile German-led project, and comes at an inconvenient time for governments \u2014 just as they are agonizing over which apps to choose to help them out of their lockdowns. At the center of the fight is the clunkily named Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) consortium, an alliance once of around 130 European computer scientists that launched last month with the aim of developing apps that adhere to the Continent's strict privacy rules. But while PEPP-PT is gaining traction among national governments \u2014 the body's leadership say eight countries are developing apps using its code, while 40 others have signed up \u2014 it is facing an exodus of members over what they say is a lack of transparency and a preference for a centralized app design. A letter out Monday signed by over 300 scientists from 25 countries \u2014 including former PEPP-PT backers \u2014 argues that decentralized app designs do a better job of preserving privacy than centralized models. \"The statement ... recommends that decentralised approaches be adopted. Interestingly, the PEPP-PT consortium, now largely composed of German research institutions, has been promoting an opposite, centralized approach,\" said Kenneth Paterson, an ETH Z\u00fcrich researcher who publicly withdrew support from PEPP-PT on Saturday in a statement accompanying the letter. The letter also has the support of researchers across institutes and universities in Canada, the U.K., U.S. and other non-European countries. It\u2019s the latest, arguably strongest push to adopt \u201cdecentralized apps\u201d and steer clear of projects like the earlier PEPP-PT project \u2014 after a series of European researchers sounded the alarm in the past days. \u201cI am personally disassociating from PEPP-PT \u2026 I can't stand behind something I don't know what it stands for. Right now, PEPP-PT is not open enough, and it is not transparent enough,\u201d said Marcel Salath\u00e9, a researcher at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne in a tweet on Friday . Instead, Salath\u00e9 said he would be pouring his efforts into a DP-3T, a group that began under the auspices of the PEPP-PT, but has now largely detached itself from the umbrella organization. Other defections swiftly followed, with researchers from ETH Z\u00fcrich, CISPA, and KU Leuven withdrawing from PEPP-PT to focus on DP-3T over the weekend. Many defections have focused on PEPP-PT's alleged lack of transparency \u2014 a claim backed up by a group of MEPs, who wrote to the organization's leadership on Friday to demand more clarity . By contrast, DP-3T has gained kudos for publishing its code. Turning tide The split underscores a rapid breakdown in trust. PEPP-PT began life as Europe's answer to surveillance-heavy technology used in countries like China to ease lockdown measures, and promised to unite the Continent's techies. Together, they would come up with privacy-friendly ways to do \"contact tracing\" \u2014 a technique of gathering data on encounters and alerting those that have crossed paths with coronavirus-infected people. But the project is now on life support as erstwhile members withdraw their backing. \u201cPEPP-PT is still trying to claim it\u2019s some kind of umbrella organization, but it\u2019s been captured by a single project,\u201d DP-3T member and University College London researcher Michael Veale told POLITICO over the phone. According to Veale, a mostly German group including the renowned Fraunhofer institute and tech entrepreneur Chris Boos are using PEPP-PT to push their more centralized approach to contact tracing at the expense of other models \u2014 including the \"decentralized\" one developed by DP-3T. Boos, who is also part of PEPP-PT's leadership team, sought to play down reports of the rift in a call with reporters on Friday, saying that PEPP-PT still supports different models of contact tracing. \"We still like the DP-3T protocol ... Our approach is that countries have to be able to choose.\" PEPP-PT's website says it backs both centralized and decentralized approaches to contact tracing. Boos said Friday he is also in favor of a \"semi-centralized\" model. At an online virtual conference the same day he also dismissed the debate raging around the relative merits of the different systems. \u201cHonestly, I could not care less. Both approaches guarantee privacy \u2014 one sends more data to a central server and the other sends more data to everyone. It doesn't matter, and this discussion has been going on for 30 years in the crypto community and they will never be able to agree.\u201d Germany center stage The dispute now puts researchers head to head \u2014 especially in Germany, where most of PEPP-PT\u2019s members are headquartered. The German government has been in talks with these institutes and companies for its app for weeks. But it will now have to hear out the criticism of the rival, \u201cdecentralized\u201d group. Over 50 German scientists signed the new letter, including one from the Fraunhofer institute, several ones from the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security and others from institutes like Bundeswehr University in Munich. In a position paper sent to the German government, a coalition of German startups that is working with PEPP-PT fired back, arguing that DP-3T's approach of storing data on phones would mean more ending up in the hands of the two companies that make the vast majority of phone software: Google and Apple. \"Looking from a global perspective, PEPP-PT is on the side of a decentralized national storage \u2014 while with DP-3T, all data would be stored globally with two giant companies, therefore more centralized than ever,\" the group, called GesundZusammen, said in a statement. PEPP-PT promised clarity, but as techies ramp up their feud, privacy-conscious governments are facing an even tougher choice. Want more analysis from POLITICO ?

{"_id": "587266261407195_1959288447538296", "content": "In just a few weeks developers across the globe have created a flurry of mobile applications to help governments fight the coronavirus pandemic. The question that\u2019s now troubling European leaders: How to pick the right one? Startups and universities have raced to design applications for \u201ccontact tracing,\u201d which gather data on people coming into close contact with one another and alert those that crossed paths with coronavirus-infected people. Last week Google and Apple announced a joint project to help out these efforts and develop their own tech to fight the virus. Controversial surveillance companies like Israel's NSO Group and the U.S.'s Palantir have also pitched their products at government offices. That presents Europe\u2019s decision-makers with a stark \u2014 and potentially disastrous \u2014 choice on which app to push to the public. Gathering too much data opens governments up to risks of privacy breaches and public backlash. Gathering too little could fail to give them the control they seek to stem the spread of the virus. Either way, they\u2019re putting the keys in the hands of organizations that they and their voters must trust with highly sensitive data. The European Commission on Thursday urged governments to pick applications that make privacy a top priority. \"We are sure that it\u2019s very useful to have such a kind of [application] in the fight against the pandemic ... But at the same time we are speaking about maybe the most sensitive data, because they are collected on the health of the citizens,\u201d Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders told POLITICO in a phone call. Commission guidance documents endorsed a project launched by a wide group of researchers at the start of April to build privacy-friendly tracing apps  that analyze Bluetooth signals between mobile phones to detect users who are close enough to infect each other \u2014 without gathering personal data or even geolocation data. The project has since led to a series of applications nearly ready for launch in Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere. Switzerland is rolling out its app very soon, researchers involved in the development said. Others, like Ireland, are rolling out theirs in the coming week. German researchers and others have an app that \"can run right now,\" according to Chris Boos, an entrepreneur that's part of the project. Google, Apple trigger hope and reservations Days after the European research project launched, Google and Apple made the surprise announcement that they would join forces to help fight the pandemic. The U.S. tech giants said they would unlock their smartphones\u2019 metrics to researchers, app designers and health authorities through a so-called application programming interface (API) in May. A key deficiency of contact tracing apps so far is that a user would have to keep the app open on their phone for it to be able to make Bluetooth connections with other phones. Google and Apple\u2019s move will allow such apps to run in the background. Julian Teicke, CEO of online insurance startup wefox that's co-developing an app for Germany, said that Google and Apple's API will be \u201cvery helpful.\" At the same time, Teicke warned that the unprecedented partnership could help the two U.S. behemoths, whose operating systems are used on 99 percent of all smartphones worldwide, gain ever-more access to sensitive user data. \"Let\u2019s make sure we have an independent layer in between that is not controlled by Google or Apple,\u201d Teicke said. \"No matter how \u2018privacy-first\u2019 the setup is \u2014 we\u2019re talking about contact lists, which are even more accurate than the data that the companies have today, and we\u2019re talking about sensitive health data,\" he added. In France, the announcement triggered similar reservations. Aymeril Hoang, a member of the scientific council advising the French government on COVID-19, told the country's Senate that Paris is in talks with Google and Apple about accessing some functionalities to be more in control of the apps' parameters. \u201cIf those negotiations were to fail and we had no other choice than use Google and Apple\u2019s turnkey solution, then we should all collectively ask ourselves ... what it means in terms of tech sovereignty and independence,\u201d Hoang said. The discussion could flame up further as the two U.S. companies signaled they also worked on contact tracing technology built directly into their core operating systems. Researchers split over trust As governments assess their options, Europe\u2019s attempts at charting a singular, unified course on tech to fight coronavirus this week started showing cracks. The community of researchers that started the PEPP-PT project split into two camps amid trust issues and a disagreement over the architecture underpinning apps. In one corner a group of researchers from France, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium and other countries published embryonic code to build a contact tracing app on the internet, based on a \u201cdecentralized\u201d design. The group, dubbed DP-3T , is preparing the Swiss application to go live soon. In the other corner, a largely German group of researchers that include Teicke's wefox, tech entrepreneur Boos, the renowned Fraunhofer institute and others, is developing an app that centralizes more data but still abides by strict privacy protections. A letter out Monday signed by over 300 scientists from 25 countries \u2014 including former PEPP-PT backers \u2014 argues that decentralized app designs do a better job of preserving privacy than centralized models. The letter \u201crecommends that decentralized approaches be adopted. Interestingly, the PEPP-PT consortium, now largely composed of German research institutions, has been promoting an opposite, centralized approach,\u201d said Kenneth Paterson, an ETH Z\u00fcrich researcher who publicly withdrew support from PEPP-PT on Saturday in a statement accompanying the letter. The letter also has the support of researchers across institutes and universities in Canada, the U.K., U.S. and other non-European countries. Apple and Google too have shown a preference to open up their systems to decentralized apps, and some privacy authorities \u2013 including the prominent U.K. Information Commissioner\u2019s Office \u2013 have endorsed the approach. Keeping control But the real fight for privacy researchers is likely to come as they try to convince lawmakers to pick their privacy-friendly apps over commercial products. Projects under PEPP-PT, DP-3T \u2014 and with the support of Google and Apple \u2014 won't register location data to protect users' privacy. That's likely to give governments less control to monitor and steer the public through the health crisis. In the U.K., that tension has already caused the government to slam Google and Apple's initiative because it would bar the National Health Service (NHS) from building a central database of people's contacts. The U.K. is already laying the groundwork to launch its own NHS app. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said \u201call data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards and would only be used for NHS care and research and we won't hold it any longer than it\u2019s needed.\" But privacy groups and political opposition are skeptical of the government's ability to handle the data securely. Other governments might be tempted to opt for different solutions, pitched by a range of surveillance, monitoring and e-health companies looking to offer their services. Apps need users The effectiveness of tools will also greatly depend on how many people are willing to use them. \u201cIt will only serve if people trust that it helps themselves [and] that autonomy is respected,\" Christiane Woopen, a German medical ethicist working on the PEPP-PT project, told a recent news conference. The app developed by Boos, Fraunhofer and others would work if around 60 percent of the population used it, according to the researchers. In the U.K., the NHS app would need up to 80 percent uptake. In Ireland, the planned app would need 45 percent uptake to be effective, according to people involved in the rollout. It\u2019s not certain every country will meet those thresholds. In Belgium, researchers this month surveyed 1,700 people on the use of apps: Only 51 percent said they would use them and 39 percent said they wouldn\u2019t. Singapore was one of the first countries to launch a contact tracing app but only about 12 percent of its population installed it, according to the BBC . Experts say building trust is crucial. According to Bart Preneel, a Belgian cryptographer who is co-developing the app for Switzerland and other countries, the privacy-friendly apps \u201ccan\u2019t be used by governments to punish people breaching quarantine measures\u201d or other invasive details of people's movements. \u201cPeople won't trust the system if it does, and you won't get uptake. People will boycott the apps and so they won't work anyway,\u201d he said. Governments are expected to launch massive public awareness campaigns once the apps are launched, to encourage people to download them. Several officials stressed strongly that they don\u2019t plan to oblige the use of the apps, but rather rely on people installing them voluntarily. According to the Commission\u2019s guidance document, this will be key if apps are to respect EU privacy rules. One country, Poland, has put in place an app to monitor if quarantined people abide by their confinement. But that app is distinct from the contact tracing apps intended for a wider public.

{"_id": "587266261407195_1956979114435896", "content": "LONDON \u2014 When it comes to a pandemic, the usual rules don't apply. As countrywide lockdowns have put economies around the world into deep freeze, policymakers are desperately searching for a way out. Solutions that before the coronavirus pandemic would have been dismissed as too draconian or invasive of citizens' privacy are now getting a hearing. Earlier this month, U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed reports the NHS is working on a new app to track and alert those who have been in significant contact with someone displaying symptoms of the virus. He also raised the prospect of \"immunity wristbands\" as a way of identifying those who might be resistant to the disease. In normal times, either measure would likely require widespread consultation and public debate about the implications, such as the one seen in recent years over the use of facial recognition by police forces. But in the midst of the crisis, the new measures would need to be rolled out in a matter of weeks. Yet even as they rush to find solutions, privacy advocates warn that ministers and MPs should carefully consider the longer-term consequences of such emergency policies. \"Parliament, in a sense, shouldn't make the mistake of looking at something now, deciding it's in the public interest, therefore making it lawfully possible without time-limiting that,\" warned England's Biometrics Commissioner Paul Wiles. \"Once we are out of the [current coronavirus crisis,] then you need to look at it again because the public interest test might fail the second time, but pass the first time,\" he said. Smartphone power The most advanced proposal to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus when strict social-distancing measures are lifted appears to be an NHS contact-tracing app. Hancock said that those who became unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus would be able securely to tell the new NHS app. The app would then send an alert anonymously to other app users that they had been in significant contact over the past few days with someone infected with the virus. \u201cAll data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards and would only be used for NHS care and research and we won't hold it any longer than it\u2019s needed,\u201d he added. As biometrics commissioner, Wiles scrutinizes the way the police use data such as DNA, fingerprints and facial recognition, but does not regulate the wider use of data. He said recent coronavirus emergency legislation could be an \"interesting model of how you might accept that something's in the public interest now, but recognize it's the kind of public interest that really relates to a particularly unusual set of circumstances.\" \"Using tracking of that kind to try and halt the spread of coronavirus. That's one thing. Using that tracking all the time, because you just fancy tracking where everybody's going, well that's very different,\" he said, while also stressing there do not appear to be any signs of the U.K. government seeking a broader reach. Acting leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey, whose party has long been skeptical about increasing surveillance powers, said the proposals are \"likely to be crucial in enabling the U.K. to move out of the lockdown at some point in the future.\" But he warned any proposal on the use of mobile phone data or other technology to track people \"must also be scrutinized properly by MPs before a final decision is made.\" Two-tier society Hancock's other suggestion earlier this month that the government is \"looking at introducing something like an immunity certificate or maybe a wristband that says 'I\u2019ve had [coronavirus] and I\u2019m immune and I can\u2019t pass it on and I\u2019m highly unlikely to catch it\u2019\" appears to be further off from being realized. The U.K. government ordered 3.5 million antibody tests in March designed to establish whether a person has already had the infection. But it was forced to scrap the tests after it emerged they were not sufficiently accurate. There is also scientific uncertainty about how long people who have recovered from COVID-19 are immune, amid reports of nearly 100 cases of people who have apparently become re-infected with the virus. \"At the moment this is an administrative fantasy. We don't have a way of demonstrating immunity, so why should you worry about having a document or wristband to do something we can't yet do,\" one former Cabinet minister, who is monitoring the issue but did not want to speak on the record, said. But it is still raising concern among civil liberty campaigners. \"It would create a massive digital identity system with potentially very stigmatizing health data,\" according to Silkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch. \"You are basically talking about creating a two-tier society where people who have had coronavirus are then allowed out into the public, and the rest of us are under house arrest. It would require a very sophisticated digital ID scheme, and there would be a high risk of fraud.\u201d But for former Home Secretary Charles Clarke, who was a driving force behind the last Labour government's controversial efforts to bring in identity cards in 2006, does not think the practicalities are \"very problematic, provided you've got a testing regime and actual tests, which work.\" \"On the basis of what I know ... I would have thought there were pretty substantial benefits to having an immunity certificate,\" he said, citing the ability to trace the spread of the disease and increasing the capacity of public services by knowing whether people can work as \"two pretty enormous pluses.\" Want more analysis from POLITICO ?

{"_id": "587266261407195_1955716627895478", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 Cracks are showing in the walls of Europe's fortress of data protection, Germany. As the coronavirus outbreak rages around the world, some of Germany's most prominent privacy experts warn that the country's data protection standards \u2014 a result of over five decades of advocacy \u2014 could suffer lasting damage as the mostly locked-down country tries to revive its economy. \u201cSince the outbreak of the pandemic, you can certainly observe how some are trying to hollow out data protection standards,\u201d Germany's Federal Commissioner for Data Protection Ulrich Kelber told POLITICO. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing uncommon \u2014 there are always several actors who are trying to exploit an emergency situation for their objectives.\u201d So far, watchdogs like Kelber's office and other democratic institutions have been mostly successful in stopping Chancellor Angela Merkel's government and regional administrations from rolling out invasive measures to tackle the pandemic. Under pressure from parliament, a new paragraph in the country\u2019s Infection Protection Act drafted by tech-savvy Health Minister Jens Spahn \u2014 which would have made mobile phone providers hand over GPS data to health authorities \u2014 was scrapped at the last minute. After local media reported that police in some federal states had been given lists of patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, regional watchdogs intervened to ban the practice. So far, as neighbors like Poland push the EU's stringent data privacy rules to the limit with mandatory tracking apps, Berlin\u2019s efforts have been confined to voluntary schemes. Researchers have rolled out an app that allows users of fitness-tracking devices to donate their data to authorities, while another pending application taps into Bluetooth signals to detect potential infections. But data protection advocates warn that, as Merkel's government starts to think about how to lift at least parts of the lockdown, a debate about data protection standards is only just taking off. \u201cThe case law is clear: You can only collect data here under very narrow conditions and never without concrete reason,\u201d former German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger told POLITICO. \"But I do observe that some political actors argue that a difficult situation like this one, where there's danger not just for individual health but also the health care system, justifies dismissing some data protection standards while claiming that those standards should only apply for good-weather situations \u2014 and that's wrong.\u201d Others have drawn parallels to the 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S., after which governments gradually expanded surveillance capabilities. Similarly, in the current situation, they warn, hard-earned data protection standards could end up as collateral damage in the coming months as the world is tackling the pandemic. \u201cMany are worried that just like back in the days during the War on Terror, new measures are introduced today that will never be taken back \u2014 and that must not happen,\u201d said Kelber\u2019s predecessor Peter Schaar, who served as Germany's federal commissioner for data protection between 2003 and 2013. \u201cRestrictions of freedom that can be justified in a difficult time like today must not become the norm.\u201d A country scarred by two authoritarian regimes In many ways, data protection as Europe knows it was born in Germany. After administrations began to automate some of their operations and compile information in databases in the 1960s, a regional parliament passed what\u2019s widely considered the world\u2019s first modern data protection law in 1970. Similar national legislation across West Germany followed in 1977. Those moves were prompted by legal scholars who became worried that with the emergence of new technology, states would gain ever more information about their citizens, which in turn would give them ever more coercive power. Scarred by the experience of the authoritarian Nazi regime, the legislation was meant to safeguard the balance of power between individuals and the state. In the decades that followed, those laws were time and again used to limit German federal states' authority to collect data. In a 1983 landmark ruling, the country's highest court decided that a census to measure the size of the population was in parts unconstitutional. The judges established that German citizens have a constitutional right to \u201cinformational self-determination,\u201d cementing in law that public offices are effectively only allowed to process personal data if a law allows it or individuals have given their explicit consent. Shortly after Germany\u2019s reunification in 1990, the country\u2019s new states in the former East \u2014 having experienced more than three additional decades of mass surveillance \u2014 passed corresponding laws. This history explains how the country became arguably the most privacy-obsessed place in the world, where even murderers have a legal \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d with a court ruling last year that a man sentenced for murder in the early 1980s has a right to having his name being deleted from online articles. But although the country is now known as the global front-runner in data protection \u2014 at times to the frustration of authorities in other EU countries \u2014 those high standards remain disputed, even at home. \u201cData protection has always been controversial, and there are many who don\u2019t think very highly of it,\u201d said Matthias B\u00e4cker, a law professor and data protection expert at the University of Mainz. \u201cToday, that's more or less projected onto the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d But B\u00e4cker also stressed that \u201cwhen it comes to data protection, 9/11 wasn\u2019t such a radical caesura ,\u201d or break, as people tend to think today. \u201cThe strategic concepts that were made law after 9/11 had, in a very similar form, already been debated in the 1990s in debates on how to fight organized crime \u2014 and you can already observe a steady expansion of state surveillance capacities in the 1990s,\u201d he said. Former Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger resigned from her post in Helmut Kohl\u2019s Cabinet in 1996 to protest constitutional changes that allowed for acoustic monitoring of private space. She said that while she does observe parallels to the time after 9/11 \u201cthe situation back then was completely different \u2014 today, we are dealing with a pandemic.\u201d But the veteran politician, who spent around eight years in government, also warned that leaders are under extraordinary pressure today. \u201cThis raises both expectations among citizens that a government should do everything that\u2019s possible to get the situation under control,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd within governments, the idea grows stronger that one can and should take drastic measures \u2014 perhaps because one feels under pressure.\u201d Like other longtime data protection advocates interviewed for this article, former Federal Commissioner for Data Protection Schaar stressed that special times require special measures and that while some measures might infringe Germany's stringent data protection standards, this is justifiable in the age of pandemic \u2014 as long as they are temporary. \u201cIf people say that at the moment they don\u2019t care what happens to their fundamental rights to data protection as long as they don\u2019t fall ill, then that\u2019s something I can certainly comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to go beyond this individual point of view. We need to ask how our society will look like after corona. And if we end up in an authoritarian surveillance state, this would be a very bad result.\u201d Want more analysis from POLITICO ?

As facial recognition technology spreads, it seems there\u2019s no hiding from it. Or is there? We teamed up with a photographer and a makeup artist to try to camouflage POLITICO\u2019s AI correspondent, Janosch Delcker, from the all-seeing eyes of a facial recognition system, with disguises ranging from an old-school balaclava to makeup designed to distort his key facial features. Then we used a free version of Amazon Web Services\u2019 facial recognition software, Rekognition, to compare the photos to a reference. The results provide striking insights into what today\u2019s facial recognition technology is capable of: Different beards, or the lack thereof, did nothing to conceal Janosch\u2019s identity; neither did dark sunglasses or a bandana that covered the complete lower half of his face. Camouflage makeup, which distorted the proportions and symmetry of his face, made it slightly more difficult for the system to identify him, but it still detected enough common features to conclude that both photos show the same person. The only disguises that worked were masks that fully or almost fully covered Janosch\u2019s face \u2014 or, surprisingly, Groucho glasses. Don\u2019t blame us if those become the new face of the revolution. 99.8 percent match 99.1 percent match No match 98.6 percent match 96.3 percent match No match True to form, an Anonymous mask does make the wearer, well, anonymous.

But there was one thing the 25-year-old Pole would not do \u2014 download a government-backed smartphone app designed to track her movements during the 14-day period of isolation. \"The terms and conditions aren't just. All the data will stay with the government for six years,\" said Dobrowolska, who has not contracted the virus and still has just under a week to go before she can go outside. \"I don't think that's right.\" Now, Dobrowolska and everyone else in Poland under quarantine will not have a choice. The country's government has made the app \u2014 which involves people uploading selfies when prompted so that officials can pinpoint their exact locations \u2014 mandatory for anyone potentially infected with the coronavirus. So far, just over 2,400 Poles have been infected and fewer than 50 people have died, according to estimates from Johns Hopkins University, although those figures continue to rise. Poland was one of the first Western countries to roll out a smartphone app that collects reams of personal information, including people's location and digital photos, in its fight to combat the pandemic. It will not be the last. With the death count increasing by the day, the digital tracker provides a possible playbook for other projects across the European Union and the United States in the coming weeks. Already, Ireland, the United Kingdom, France and parts of Spain have signaled they will push ahead with their own apps, while U.S. government agencies are using mobile advertising data to track the spread of the virus. Scientists in eight EU countries are also working jointly on code for an app that analyzes Bluetooth signals from people's smartphones to see with whom they have come in contact in recent weeks. Governments are taking different approaches. Some are asking people to download an app voluntarily, while others are sourcing smartphone tracking data from mobile service providers. But the Polish project represents the most advanced effort yet to enforce a mandatory check-up via app anywhere in the EU or North America. As officials around the world struggle to contain the coronavirus, they're increasingly turning to the online surveillance first trialed across Asia to track people's movements, often in real time. That has raised questions about privacy \u2014 including when the tracking will be switched off. \"We need an independent state figure that's not the government who can guarantee this data will eventually be deleted,\" said Arnoldo Frigessi , a professor at the University of Oslo who's helping the Norwegian government develop its own coronavirus app that is expected to be released in the coming weeks. \"We need to ask the questions: When will this stop, and who will get to decide?\" So far, politicians, scientists and others involved in projects across Europe and the U.S. say privacy standards will be upheld. Regulators in several countries have also given their blessings to certain efforts, citing public health concerns. Government officials and researchers across Europe and the U.S. also told POLITICO that there was a growing need to access smartphones' GPS location data and potentially bluetooth signals to track the spread of COVID-19. Currently, governments and the European Commission are relying on anonymized mobile phone data that does not offer sufficient granularity on individuals' exact movements. \"The police won\u2019t have to monitor the places of quarantine,\" said Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister, when announcing the country's coronavirus app would become mandatory. \"We will know if people are following the rules.\" First Poland, then the world To see what awaits other parts of the Western world when similar smartphone apps are eventually released, POLITICO talked to 11 Polish citizens about the country's tracking system, which has been downloaded by more than 90,000 people, according to government figures. Each person installed the app on receiving a text message after they notified officials that they had either contracted the virus or had returned from abroad. The service, which shared people's data with a number of government agencies and the police, required them to upload a selfie to the app within a 20-minute window after receiving a text message. The tracking system then checked if they had remained indoors, based on their smartphone's GPS location data. !function(e,t,i,n,r,d){function o(e,i,n,r){t[s].list.push({id:e,title:r,container:i,type:n})}var a=\"script\",s=\"InfogramEmbeds\",c=e.getElementsByTagName(a),l=c[0];if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&&0===t.location.protocol.indexOf(\"file\")&&(i=\"http:\"+i),!t[s]){t[s]={script:i,list:[]};var m=e.createElement(a);m.async=1,m.src=i,l.parentNode.insertBefore(m,l)}t[s].add=o;var p=c[c.length-1],f=e.createElement(\"div\");p.parentNode.insertBefore(f,p),t[s].add(n,f,r,d)}(document,window,\"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",\"f5c56773-311a-4433-898e-ce230740ac91\",\"interactive\",\"\"); Since the app was released in mid-March people's experiences have varied, with many willing to give up their personal information to help reduce the number of overall infections. Most said the app is prone to failure, not a surprise as the Polish government created it in just three days based on an out-of-the-box service offered by a third-party developer. Still, only two people who spoke to POLITICO had refused outright to download the app, although others questioned how the government could order the elderly and others with limited access to smartphones to participate. A government spokesperson said that exemptions would be made for those who did not have internet access or do not own a smartphone. Under Polish law, people who break the quarantine rules face fines of upto \u20ac6,550, but it remains unclear how Warsaw can force people to download the app. Poles' experiences in recent weeks highlight how creating such systems \u2014 often with little time to check for bugs and create security protections \u2014 may also prove difficult for other governments. Maciej Putniorz, a 28-year-old from Krakow, downloaded the app soon after returning home from abroad just before Poland went into full lockdown. Despite receiving up to three text messages per day asking him to upload a photograph, he said he was mostly willing to give up his data because he was already sharing more personal information with other apps like Facebook. \"I know the data may be collected, but we are in such a hard time right now, this isn't a problem for me,\" he added a day before he officially finished his two-week quarantine period. When Putniorz punched in his cellphone number into the app, other personal details like his address and government identification had already been uploaded, likely from official databases, he said. Still, Putniorz's experience has not been straightforward. Even though he uploaded selfies on a daily basis, he also received almost daily visits from the police to check he was staying indoors \u2014 something the app was supposed to make redundant. A government spokesperson said that police would still check on those in quarantine even if they were using the app. !function(e,t,i,n,r,d){function o(e,i,n,r){t[s].list.push({id:e,title:r,container:i,type:n})}var a=\"script\",s=\"InfogramEmbeds\",c=e.getElementsByTagName(a),l=c[0];if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&&0===t.location.protocol.indexOf(\"file\")&&(i=\"http:\"+i),!t[s]){t[s]={script:i,list:[]};var m=e.createElement(a);m.async=1,m.src=i,l.parentNode.insertBefore(m,l)}t[s].add=o;var p=c[c.length-1],f=e.createElement(\"div\");p.parentNode.insertBefore(f,p),t[s].add(n,f,r,d)}(document,window,\"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",\"59f451a5-38cf-4560-9c7a-d0804535099f\",\"interactive\",\"\"); \u0141ukasz Wali\u0142ko also had daily police visits since his return to Krakow from London in early March. After downloading the app, Wali\u0142ko said he had struggled to upload photos as either the digital service froze or it failed to store his image in the government database. Often, the 30-year-old got a text message telling him he had 20 minutes to confirm his location, only to find the app said he had less time to meet the deadline once he had logged in. \"It's not working so well,\" said Wali\u0142ko, who has tested negative for COVID-19. \"When I checked the app's rating on Google's app store, it's not rated very highly.\" More troubles likely lie ahead, especially as many locals finish their two-week quarantines. Wali\u0142ko has just finished his government-imposed isolation, and was told by the police \u2014 during their daily visit to his house\u2014 that he is now free to leave. But only hours after his all-clear, the Pole received another text message from authorities, ordering him to upload another selfie as if he was still potentially infected. \"I deleted the app straight away,\" he said. \"The police told me I was in the all clear, but the app said I still had to confirm my location.\" !function(e,t,i,n,r,d){function o(e,i,n,r){t[s].list.push({id:e,title:r,container:i,type:n})}var a=\"script\",s=\"InfogramEmbeds\",c=e.getElementsByTagName(a),l=c[0];if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&&0===t.location.protocol.indexOf(\"file\")&&(i=\"http:\"+i),!t[s]){t[s]={script:i,list:[]};var m=e.createElement(a);m.async=1,m.src=i,l.parentNode.insertBefore(m,l)}t[s].add=o;var p=c[c.length-1],f=e.createElement(\"div\");p.parentNode.insertBefore(f,p),t[s].add(n,f,r,d)}(document,window,\"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",\"633de1e6-df9d-4732-b835-41f151fb9a19\",\"interactive\",\"\");", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "Poland\u2019s coronavirus app offers playbook for other governments"}
{"_id": "587266261407195_1938436452956829", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 European researchers think they have found a way to use mobile phones to contain the spread of coronavirus \u2014 and help people avoid infection \u2014 without sacrificing the region's high standards on privacy. Eight countries have taken part in the project that will, on Wednesday, release the code for an app that analyzes Bluetooth signals between mobile phones to detect users who are close enough to infect each other, members of the group of about 130 academics, activists and technologists told POLITICO. That data will be temporarily stored on the phones. If users later test positive for the virus, the app alerts anyone who has been around them in preceding days. Unlike more invasive surveillance technology being used to track infections in parts of the world with lower standards of data privacy, the new European software embeds safeguards to encrypt data and anonymize personal information, according to some of the organizations involved, which include the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin and the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale in Lausanne. This makes it safe from abuse by third parties, including governments, and ensures data protection standards won't suffer irreparable damage as Europe tackles the pandemic. \u201cPeople have fought very hard to get where we are,\" said Chris Boos, the CEO of Berlin-based artificial intelligence company Arago, who is part of the project's leadership team and also advises Angela Merkel\u2019s chancellery on digital policy. \u201cAnd we shouldn't just throw our civilization out of the window.\" Germany will be among the first countries to launch an app based on the code. That hasn't been officially confirmed, but Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, which is coordinating Berlin's response to the pandemic, has hinted that his institute has teamed up with others to work on such a voluntary app. He told reporters during a press conference on Tuesday that, ideally, the entire German population would sign up to it. Other countries in Europe could soon follow suit. The aim of releasing the code, Boos said, is to facilitate the launch of national apps across the region that can communicate with each other to pick up Bluetooth phone signals and help avoid infections. Current members of the initiative, which is financed through donations, include organizations from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Spain, but the initiative remains open for new countries to join, including from outside the Continent, he added. \u201cI think Europe is a very good starting place for this because we have this long tradition of privacy,\u201d Boos said. \u201cBut of course, we're opening this up to other places, as well \u2014 and we already received the first requests from outside Europe when weren\u2019t even out yet.\u201d Help Europe bounce back The release of the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) toolkit responds to pressure on political leaders to find ways to revive locked-down Europe's economy without prompting a spike in new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. To do that, epidemiologists need better data on where infections take place so that those who might have contracted the pathogen can isolate themselves. So far, countries like Germany have mostly tracked infections by interviewing those who are infected. But that workflow is lengthy and can be prone to errors, with patients often unable to remember everyone they crossed paths with in the preceding two weeks, the incubation period of COVID-19. At the same time, patients tend to carry electronic devices with them that can track their whereabouts, prompting countries around the world to tap into that information to better identify new infections. China, where the virus originated, has mobilized a vast array of mass surveillance tools, such as a mandatory app that scores individuals based on their contagion risk and shares the information with authorities. But most Western democracies bristle at such invasive solutions, which privacy advocates warn would do lasting harm to society. The advantage of PEPP-PT, according to its developers, is that downloading the app will be voluntary and the code makes it virtually impossible to reveal the identity of the people using the devices: Two phones will never exchange data directly, and the users' aliases are changed frequently. Such privacy standards, they argue, make their technology different from solutions like an app launched in Singapore which also monitors the exchange of Bluetooth signals to detect when phone users are near one another. The challenge is to convince enough people to install the app to make it an effective tool. Epidemiologist Marcel Salath\u00e9, who heads a lab for digital epidemiology at EPFL, quoted research that in order to keep numbers of new infections down, ideally 60 percent of a population would use such technology. But he also stressed that \u201cin principle, already a few people [using the app would] help to make a difference,\u201d not least because the scheme comes on top of other measures that are already implemented to slow down new infections. \u201cAt the end of the day, if you have 40 percent of a population using such a system, that will still have a strong impact,\u201d Salath\u00e9 said.

{"_id": "587266261407195_1958985017568639", "content": "Digital Politics is a column about the global intersection of technology and the world of politics. There's a new entrant in the rarefied club of Big Tech: national governments. As politicians grapple with how to handle a global pandemic that has shuttered entire countries, decimated national economies and left 160,000 people dead , they're turning to tactics better associated with Google, Apple and Facebook than with the staid world of government boffins. To track people's everyday movements, countries from Australia to Austria have soaked up piles of (anonymized) smartphone data from local telecoms operators. To police widespread lockdowns, others are relying on location details gleaned from digital advertising sold through popular online services. And almost 40 governments worldwide have rolled out \u2014 or are about to \u2014 their own coronavirus apps for everything from informing people if they've been in contact with anyone infected with COVID-19 to ensuring those that already have it stay home. All of this should set off alarm bells. Big Tech has become a global punching bag because of fears that Silicon Valley has too much control over our daily lives. But in their legitimate efforts to keep people safe, officials across the European Union, United States and elsewhere are quickly falling into the same trap \u2014 creating a government surveillance network on the fly, with little oversight and almost no clarity about when it will be shut down. People are growing increasingly skeptical about how Google, Amazon and Facebook collect reams of our personal data, often in opaque ways that are hard to decipher. So why shouldn\u2019t governments come under the same scrutiny? Governments that have a track record of failing to keep such digital information safe, lack Big Tech's technical expertise and will, for the most part, be beholden to themselves about when to call off their digital land grab. In the fight to halt the global pandemic, the public is being asked to put aside any fears in the name of public health. But at some point, the number of infections worldwide will start to fall, while governments\u2019 \"Big Tech\" moment will likely hang around well after the COVID-19 crisis fades. Trust us, we\u2019re the government To be fair to policymakers, they have tried to lay out what can, and what cannot, be done with this unprecedented collection of people's (very sensitive) data. The European Commission just published a set of (voluntary) guidelines for creating coronavirus apps, including efforts to put national privacy watchdogs in charge and place strict time limits for how long data can be stored. Governments, too, have said they'll stick to existing data protection rules \u2014 despite that, in places such as Poland, which has made its app mandatory for those in quarantine due to COVID-19, officials say they'll hang on to the information for up to six years. Such assurances should be taken with a pinch of salt. Everyone is already at full stretch with public health services struggling to cope with rising numbers of infections and lawmakers turning over every last rock to keep economies afloat. In times of crises, fundamental rights like privacy can often seem like secondary concerns \u2014 particularly when governments are enticingly close to grabbing large amounts of people's information in ways that, until recently, were strictly off-limits. Unanswered questions abound. Who will have access to the data? Where will it be stored? Who decides when it'll be deleted? These are the questions officials have been asking Big Tech for years. So it's only right \u2014 even amid the current crisis \u2014 that policymakers should be explicit in their responses with their own efforts before they start vacuuming up information as if they're the latest digital fad from Silicon Valley. Security, too, is a real concern. Even Google and Apple, which have joined forces to create a (mostly) privacy-conscious effort to track people's movements through their smartphones, admit their offering will not be 100 percent secure. In the mad rush to get something on the market, most governments are either outsourcing their COVID-19 tracking tools to local tech firms or buying boilerplate solutions from existing suppliers. The development of these services is done in a matter of weeks, if not days. That may work well when offering regular medical advice or the latest updates on how to file your taxes \u2014 most Western governments already have digital services for such things. But it's a whole different ballgame when officials are collecting sensitive health data, people's specific locations or other information that would prove extremely harmful if it fell into the wrong hands (either within governments or with online fraudsters). It's become a clich\u00e9 to say these are unprecedented times. But if the increased scrutiny of Big Tech in recent years has taught us anything, it\u2019s that a healthy dose of skepticism is required when presented with tech offerings that seem too good to be true. For years, politicians have decried how companies have harvested people\u2019s data in the name of improving lives. It's only right they\u2019re now held to the same standard.

Data collection can be essential to understand and respond to the Covid-19 emergency, but creating such digital surveillance risks failure and adverse side-effects. Since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, digital rights defenders warned that collecting massive volumes of citizens' data can lead to an increase in state digital surveillance powers - which might pose a . \"We can have privacy and security. It is not a zero-sum game,\" the spokesperson of the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency, Nicole Romain, told this website. \"Given the unprecedented situation, restrictions or limitations to many fundamental rights are legitimate, as long as they are consistent with our legal safeguards and are in place only as long as necessary,\" she added. Last week, called on member states not to use the coronavirus pandemic \"as a cover to usher in a new era of greatly expanded systems of invasive digital surveillance\". However, the concerns over the abuse of surveillance power of some countries has even been highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO) itself. \"When we talk about surveillance in the case of public health, the gathering of information about individuals, their movements must be done with the consent of the community and in many cases of the individual themselves,\" said WHO key advisor, Michael Ryan, earlier this year. Tracking people like never before? As long as measures in place use aggregated and anonymised data there should be, in principle, no impact on privacy rights since they would be in line with EU data protection rules. \"However, new local apps are appearing by the minute and it is not clear if all of them are in line with GDPR [EU's data protection rules] and ePrivacy,\" said the head of policy at European Digital Rights, Diego Naranjo. Likewise, Naranjo believes that the coronavirus crisis reaffirms the need to update the EU's ePrivacy rules - which have been blocked by member states for more than three years. According to Lucie Krahulcova, a policy analyst at NGO AccessNow, \"the most worrying are tracking applications which use a combination of mobile network data together with bluetooth and wifi pings to track location\". More and more member states are launching apps to monitor quarantined patients or trace contact, which prompted that the European Commission recently announced to fight and exit the pandemic. However, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) called, instead, for a pan-European Covid-19 app amid the proliferation of country-specific apps. Poland was the first EU country to launch a mobile application amid the pandemic - requires people to take selfies to prove they are quarantining properly, but personal data will be retained for six years. However, Germany, Ireland, the UK, France, Italy and Spain have also announced their plans for their own apps. Germany and Spain the exception Meanwhile, telecom operators agreed to share aggregated mobile phone location data with the commission to track the spread of the coronavirus. The EU's data watchdog backed the commission's plan, but stressed that \"it would also be preferable to limit access to the data to authorised experts in spatial epidemiology, data protection and data science\". Although data protection rules still apply, some countries have slightly changed their data protection rules. Germany, for instance, has amended its GDPR-enabling legislation . One can assume that temporary measures taken during a state of emergency will disappear once the emergency is over, but experts warned about the negative possible outcome of this 'experiment'. \"We must ensure that the measures governments are taking right now do not transform this health crisis into a global human rights crisis,\" said Estelle Mass\u00e9, a senior policy analyst at NGO Access Now.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "Coronavirus: Are we trading privacy for security?"}

One obvious attraction for health officials is the possibility of using smartphones to find out with whom someone diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact. But can this be done without intrusive surveillance and access to our devices that store a wealth of private information? Anonymised and aggregated Anonymised and aggregated Firms can \u201canonymise\u201d location data received from your smartphone by stripping out personal identifiers. It can then be presented in an \u201caggregate\u201d form where individual and identifiable data points are not accessable. Your location data is already likely being used that way by mobile operators to feed traffic information to map apps. And it is such information that the European Commission has requested from mobile operators, which can determine the location of users by measuring the phone signal strength from more than one network tower. In fact, mobile operators have already been providing such data to health researchers in both France and Germany. Google, which collects large amounts of data from users of its myriad services, plans to publish information about the movement of people to allow governments to gauge the effectiveness of social distancing measures. In particular, it will display percentage point increases and decreases in visits to such locations as parks, shops, and workplaces. Bluetooth sleuth Bluetooth sleuth Anonymised and aggregated only get you so far. To get practical data like the people with whom an infected person has had contact, you need to get invasive. Or do you? Singapore pioneered a method using Bluetooth. This is the technology that allows people to connect wireless headphones or earbuds to their smartphones. If you\u2019ve ever connected a pair to your phone in a public place you\u2019ll probably have noticed the devices of others nearby. It is this feature of Bluetooth that the Singaporean app TraceTogether exploits. Someone who has downloaded the app and kept their Bluetooth enabled will begin to register codes from all people who have the app on their phone and come within range. Germany is looking at rolling out a similar system. Privacy concerns Privacy concerns The Singaporean app is designed to reduce privacy concerns. For one, the app is voluntary. Another is that it doesn\u2019t track your location, rather it just collects codes from the phones of people with whom you come into relatively close contact. That information is only uploaded to the operator of the app when a person declares himself or herself as having come down with COVID-19. The TraceTogether app then matches up the codes (non-identifiable except to the operator of the system) with the telephone number of owners, and then messages them they had been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Spies in charge Spies in charge The other means to get practical information is to utilise the location data of phone users. This is the method chosen by Israel, which put internal security agency Shin Bet in charge of obtaining the data from mobile phone operators. It also gets access to data on the movement of people for a two week period to help track down people exposed to the coronavirus. Shin Bet does not get access to a person\u2019s phone, however. \u2018Proportionate and temporary\u2019 \u2018Proportionate and temporary\u2019 Putting the fox in charge of guarding the henhouse is unlikely to sit well with rights and privacy groups, although they don\u2019t exclude the use of technology to help combat the crisis. \u201cHowever, States\u2019 efforts to contain the virus must not be used as a cover to usher in a new era of greatly expanded systems of invasive digital surveillance,\u201d said a statement issued Thursday by 100 rights groups including Amnesty International, Privacy International and Human Rights Watch. They warn that \u201can increase in state digital surveillance powers, such as obtaining access to mobile phone location data, threatens privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of association, in ways that could violate rights and degrade trust in public authorities \u2014 undermining the effectiveness of any public health response.\u201d They said any additional digital surveillance powers should be necessary, proportionate and temporary. \u201cWe cannot allow the COVID-19 pandemic to serve as an excuse to gut individual\u2019s right to privacy,\u201d the groups said.", "source_name": "EURACTIV", "title": "Smartphone vs virus, is privacy always going to be the loser?"}

Given the severity of this unprecedented situation, the Italian government, like those in Spain and France, is taking drastic measures, is asking its citizens to help contain the spread of the virus, despite its significantly negative impact on daily life and the economy. However, Europe must also do its part, with determination and courage. The European Union has a political and moral duty to establish a rapid and coordinated response from all countries. It should also take a series of extraordinary measures to limit the economic and social impact of the epidemic and to safeguard citizens\u2019 health. The Commission and the various parliamentary institutions have already begun putting in place the first economic initiatives, to allow European public investments to o\u2011 set the economic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Furthermore, the European Structural and Investment Funds, already held by the Member States, can be an essential tool. I also support the Commission\u2019s proposal to renounce, for this year, the reimbursement of unspent pre-financing of \u20ac8bn, allowing Member States to invest in health services. However, I am convinced that in tackling a global challenge of this importance, we need to start thinking differently. For this, we have a great ally that we are much underestimating - technology. The use of new technologies is opening up unique landscapes in the worlds of work and education: students taking virtual classes, companies and professionals carrying out their activities remotely, workers and social forces organising themselves online. The future that we imagined, and that we were gradually reaching, has started to become a reality in the space of a few days, from e-learning to smart working to the extensive use of e-government resources to administer large democracies and complex societies. The drive towards a digital transformation, however, cannot only be the consequence of the ongoing emergency; it must also be part of the response and counterattack. I was impressed by the South Korean approach to emergency management. The Asian country, a stable democracy similar in size to Italy, is experimenting with cross-analysis of surveillance footage, GPS data obtained from phones and credit card transactions and of COVID-19 positive people to test anyone who may have been exposed to the virus, perhaps when shopping or going to work. Furthermore, technology is also helping operators manage the hospitalisation of the sick, with positive people quarantined at home monitored via a smartphone app until a hospital bed becomes available. These experiments, of course, pose huge questions over patients\u2019 rights to privacy. However, they also present us with an opportunity to limit the need for a prolonged lockdown with more useful and intelligent policies that allow communities to escape the grip of isolation. In an era in which data analysis can monitor our needs, interests and orientations, the authorities cannot limit themselves to asking the population to stay at home. Europe has a historic opportunity to bend the digitisation of society to the interests of its citizens and not just to those of the market. Based on what has been done in Seoul, the EU must bring together all the major international players in the ICT sector to form a new task force to respond to the plight of the Coronavirus with the latest and most innovative tools offered by the digital revolution.", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "Taking COVID-19 to task"}

Over time, the entire economic activity will be influenced by the new 5G infrastructures, accelerating the digital transformation of companies and, consequently, the fourth industrial revolution. The automotive, transport and distribution industries, as well as infrastructure networks and healthcare, are all sectors that will be transformed by the advent of 5G. Driverless trucks and cars, \"smart\" buildings and cities and remote medical interventions are just some of the innovations possible thanks to 5G. How long will we have to wait? 5G technology is currently being developed worldwide. The EU adopted its action plan for the technology in 2016 with the objective of launching 5G services in all 28 member states by the end of 2020 at the latest, followed by a rapid build-up to ensure uninterrupted coverage in all urban areas and along major transport paths by 2025. Between 2014 and 2020, the bloc spent \u20ac700 million on 5G technology with the private sector estimated to have invested more than \u20ac3 billion. Finnish telecommunications company Nokia, announced last year for instance, that it had secured a \u20ac500 million loan from the European Investment Bank to develop its 5G network. Sweden's Ericsson, meanwhile, secured \u20ac250 million . According to an analysis by the Global System for Mobile Association (GSMA), it is estimated that by the middle of the decade about one in three mobile connections will use fifth-generation networks. In particular, the penetration of 5G technology in Europe is estimated at 31% in 2025, which translates into 217 million connections. Antennas and frequencies The frequency waves used by 5G have a shorter range than for previous systems. That means more antennas, closer to the ground, are needed. The frequencies used in the implementation phase of 5G networks (3.5 GHz and 700 MHz) are slightly different from the frequencies currently used, but this does not mean that these changes affect the way the antennas work. The 26 GHz band will be used in the next phase for specific services. Is 5G bad for your health? This is not yet known. So far no one has been able to answer this question. Many argue that as more antennas are needed, health risks will increase proportionately. But these antennas should be state-of-the-art antennas and the electromagnetic radiation emitted should be significantly lower than the levels emitted by the existing 4G / 3G / 2G networks. Still, some groups in Europe are lobbying against the technology, including grONDES (a play on word with the French words for rumble and waves) which argued earlier this year that \"the number of scientific studies carried out by respected institutes and organisations which confirm the harmfulness of mobile technologies for the health and the environments is constantly increasing.\" A report from the EU Commission released last year noted however that \"studies have not yet yielded clear evidence of the impact on mammals, birds or insects\". \"The lack of clear evidence to inform the development of exposure guidelines to 5G technology leaves open the possibility of unintended biological consequences,\" it added. Is it the end of 4G? No, because 5G will not be immediately and uniformly implemented worldwide so the two systems will continue to exist alongside one another, especially as not all devices are 5G-compatible.

The pandemic has reignited self-reliance ambitions and given new impetus to . There is a serious debate about re-shoring production from China, as the pandemic exposed the vulnerability of supply chains from pharmaceuticals to electronics. and are bracing for acquisitions of strategic assets like biotechnologies by tightening investment screening tools. The pursuit of resilience should not result in isolationism. But recently, for bigger European \u00b4champions\u00b4 to match China\u00b4s techno-nationalist industrial policy. Transatlantic mistrust on digital matters also urges Europe to do things on its own, from developing a to and ensuring that Europeans have . While the bloc's resolve to be stronger in tech deserves praise, an inward-looking strategy is doomed to fail unless it is accompanied by proactive cooperation with like-minded countries. In a paradox, the best way for Europe to ensure its tech independence is through collaboration with allies. Europe cannot go it alone if it wants to preserve its technological edge, protect its security, and ensure a democratic technology future and a vibrant economy in the post-pandemic world. Democratic alliances remain an unmatched source of European strength as it deals with a rising China. Beijing's ambitions to lead in technologies like AI, 5G, quantum computing, and genomics, if successful, would provide China with unprecedented economic, political, and military advantages. This poses a threat to liberal democracy and would leave Europe's quest for technological 'sovereignty' stillborn. Economically, China's plans to boost indigenous innovation through subsidies, protectionism, and the absorption of foreign technology threaten the competitiveness of countries playing by market rules. Politically, Chinese tech firms implicated in human rights abuses in Xinjiang play leading roles in setting global standards for applications like facial recognition, empowering authoritarianism. Built by CCP? In the security sphere, reliance on Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked firms for the construction of critical information infrastructure is hardly conducive to any country\u00b4s technological autonomy \u2013 and brings mounting cybersecurity and strategic risks. The EU and tech-leading member states \u2013 such as Germany, France, and the Netherlands \u2013 should join forces with like-minded countries. Together with the United States, Canada, Japan, and South Korea among others, they should spearhead the creation of a new coordination body for multinational technology policy \u2013 a technology alliance. This grouping would help preserve competitiveness and security by protecting critical technologies, strengthen collaborative innovation, and anchor emerging technology adoption and governance in democratic values and norms. These three lines of effort would be the foundation for a secure and prosperous Europe. First, Europe's long-term economic health is threatened by Beijing's goals to wean itself off foreign technology in fields like aerospace, semiconductors, and robotics. EU member states should not let this be a fait accompli. This does not mean cutting off China as a trade partner. It does require placing restrictions on certain exports and knowledge transfers to make sure China cannot indigenise the state-of-the-art. Such controls, like for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, must be targeted and multilateral. Multinational coordination is also needed to share information on Chinese state-backed investments, or R&D partnerships with universities. Second, investments must be made to maintain leadership in key fields. Breakthroughs in areas like 5G, quantum information science, and AI will have far-reaching economic impact, and profound effects on national and international security. Launching joint civilian and defence R&D projects with like-minded partners is one way of securing continued technological advantage. Another is to join forces on expensive efforts to restructure vital supply chains. The pandemic exposed the brittleness of Europe's position. Countries like Japan, which is , share this plight. Resilience will require joint solutions \u2013 and create new opportunities and markets. Finally, coordinating the deployment and governance of emerging technologies is front and centre at protecting the values that unite Europe. China's proliferation of surveillance technology \u2013 used for repression at home and increasingly exported \u2013 is a direct threat to democratic values; curbing it will require a coordinated response by the world's leading democracies. This same group should also reassert themselves in the world's standards-setting bodies, like the UN\u00b4s ITU, that are increasingly targeted by Beijing to influence the make-up of the digital economy. Europe stands at an inflection point. Decisions its leaders make in coming months will set the course for its post-pandemic future. How they act to secure Europe's technological viability will determine the continent's economic, military, and political power for decades. Technological sovereignty will not flow from mimicking Chinese industrial policy. Instead, Europeans should embrace their allies to build a tech future that is dynamic, innovative, and competitive.

And Belgium is so far the only member state which stated facial recognition is in breach of national law, although . But for the general public, a recent study found 80 percent of Europeans are against sharing their facial data with authorities. Facial-recognition technologies can be used to watch, track or analyse citizens - and even score them for \"social credit\", Chinese-style - but also to unblock a mobile phone or make a bank transfer. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, various technologies have been proposed as a magic bullet that could help to halt the spread of the coronavirus, such as tracking apps on smartphones or heat-cameras doing temperature checks in offices. Moscow, for example, has used facial recognition technology to monitor whether citizens were following quarantines. This is why EDRi called last week (13 May) on member states and the European Commission . \"The introduction of facial recognition into cities is a radical and dystopic idea which significantly threatens our freedoms and poses fundamental questions about the kind of societies we want to live in,\" warned Ioannis Kouvakas from NGO Privacy International. \"We need to permanently ban its roll out now before it's too late,\" he added. A report from the European Agency for Fundamental Rights points out that \" must regulate the deployment and use of facial recognition technologies\". Orwellian control? \"Apps cannot be used for mass surveillance. Individuals will keep control on their data,\" EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders told MEPs during the last plenary (14 May) . \"Apps should be only used during the crisis and be deactivated at the latest when the pandemic is over,\" he added. However, privacy defenders claimed that the real risk caused by widening surveillance tech-enabled solutions is that it could continue long after the pandemic is over. According to Fanny Hidv\u00e9gi from NGO Access Now, \"protecting digital rights also promotes public health\" - but the suspension of data protection rights in Hungary shows why the EU should step up in these matters. \"Some [tech companies and industry] see opportunities, when others suffer and authorities are struggling for air,\" a biophysicist and expert on physiological biometrics technology, Martin Zizi, told this website. \"We fool ourselves if we think that our constitution protects us against totalitarian urges,\" he added. \"We may join China as a dystopian totalitarian state not because we want to, but because of the greed of some and the fear of everyone,\" he warned, referring a 'national reputation' system developed by China. The Chinese \"social credit\" scheme, which relies on the use of facial recognition and other technologies, has been strongly criticised for determining the opportunities, privileges and freedom citizens can enjoy. Leaked 'ban' Earlier this year, a leaked paper of the EU's white paper on artificial intelligence (AI) revealed that the European Commission was considering to impose a temporary ban on the use of facial recognition technology. - although this technology is expected to be subjected to binding requirements when considering \"high-risk\" applications, according to the EU's roadmap on AI. \"The EU should be and remain a beacon for the rule of law and individual rights: privacy is democracy,\" said Zizi. \"Once we start to be afraid of not being able to say [or do] things freely without fear, we already have lost our freedom of thinking. Is this the world you want to live in?\" he added. According to Lotte Houwing, policy advisor at Bits of Freedom, \"we are shaping the world of tomorrow with the measures we are taking today\". \"Surveillance is not a medicine,\" she said.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "Pandemic speeds calls for ban on facial recognition"}

However, the human rights group Amnesty International warned on Monday (11 May) that the use of surveillance technologies to combat Covid-19 is, in many cases, not compatible with international human rights standards and could even lead to a more intrusive digital surveillance state. \"Given that this level of digital tracing for public health is so novel, necessity and efficiency need to be proved,\" said Claudio Guarneri from Amnesty Tech, part of Amnesty International, adding contact-tracing apps . This potential backlash could encourage the upcoming German EU's council presidency in the second half of the year to address when applying tracing apps or any upcoming technologies, as well as when exporting surveillance technologies, Lena Rohrbach from Amnesty International Germany told this website. Meanwhile, MEPs on the European Parliament's committee on civil liberties warned last week that \"whenever personal data is processed in the context of fighting Covid-19, data protection rules are indispensable\". Some member states have changed - either slightly or significantly - their data protection rules to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Hungary's example Earlier this month, the Hungarian government suspended certain rights under the EU's data protection rules until the end of . As a result, NGO Access Now, Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, and Civil Liberties Union for Europe on Monday all called on the EU's data protection watchdog to investigate the compatibility of a Hungarian government decree-law and the EU data protection rules. The Hungarian decree limits the rights under Articles 15 to 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) linked to the processing of data conducted by both public and private entities for the fight against the Covid-19. These include the right to access personal data, the right to not be subjected to profiling or the right to be forgotten. Additionally, the new rules establish time limits for the exercise of remedy rights, including the right to lodge a complaint and the right to an effective judicial remedy - which are guaranteed by Articles 77 to 79 of the GDPR. \"The decision by the Hungarian government to limit the application of data subjects' rights is disproportionate, unjustified, and potentially harmful to the public's response to fight the virus,\" the three civil society organisations warned in . The head of the European Data Protection Supervisor, Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski, said last week that data protection should not become a problem to enabling digital solutions for a public health crisis. \"We have the moral responsibility to use the tools that we have on our hands to fight the pandemic, but we have also the responsibility to minimise the impact of these technologies on our fundamental rights,\" Wiewi\u00f3rowski said.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "New warning on virus apps' digital privacy safeguards"}

It not clear yet what kind of measures the commission might propose in an attempt to balance conflicting concerns and interests. On the one hand, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo and vice-president Mike Pence have been deployed to urge EU countries to impose a ban on Huawei's technology in their telecommunications networks. \"We won't be able to share information with them, we won't be able to work alongside them,\" Pompeo said upon his return from a trip to Europe. The US claims that links between companies like Huawei and the Communist Party of China (CPC) gives rise to risks of espionage. \"We think (the European countries) will make good decisions when they understand that risk,\" Pompeo said. On the other hand, the telecommunication industry's trade body, GSMA, fears that delays in the implementation of 5G in Europe will lead to missed opportunities in the development of the 'Internet of Things', such as self-driving cars, smart cities and smart healthcare. etc. And China is pushing back. \"Using security reasons to hype, obstruct or restrict normal cooperation between companies in the end will only hurt one's own interests,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said during a press briefing. Malicious purposes Like the US, countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan have already taken steps to ban Huawei from supplying equipment for their future fifth generation mobile broadband networks for reasons of national security, while Canada is still considering which steps to take. Meanwhile in Poland, a Huawei sales manager is under arrest on suspicion of espionage. And in December the daughter of the company's founder, deputy chairwoman Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada at the request of the US justice department for allegedly breaching the ban on dealings with Iran and violating intellectual property law. France has already barred Huawei from providing technology for the country's sensitive networks, and cyber agencies in a number of other EU member states have reviewed or are currently reviewing possible security risks. In the US, the House of Representatives' intelligence committee found in 2012 that \"China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes\". China's national intelligence law from 2017 states that organisations such as Huawei must \"support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work\". China has dedicated a lot of effort to reassure European lawmakers to gain access to the EU's common market, the biggest in the world. In an , China's ambassador to the EU, Zhang Ming, warned leaders in the EU not to draw \"an Iron Curtain\", which would \"upset global economic and scientific innovation\". He recommended Europeans to take \"a holistic view\" on the issue of security risks. \"The Chinese government calls on Chinese companies operating overseas to strictly observe laws and regulations of the host country, has and will never ask Chinese companies to engage in illegal activities,\" Zhang Ming wrote. Huawei in Brussels The Huawei company has set up cyber-security centres in the UK and Germany, which are soon to be followed by a similar centre close to the European institutions in Brussels. According to Huawei, these centres serve for \"testing, verification and engagement with stakeholders\". \"We are probably the most open and transparent organisation in the world. We are probably the most poked and prodded organisation too,\" Huawei's cyber security chief John Suffolk told the BBC. And in interviews with American and European media Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, has insistently emphasised that the company would never allow China's government to access customer data. \"China's ministry of foreign affairs has officially clarified that no law in China requires any company to install mandatory back doors. Huawei and me personally have never had any request from any government to provide improper information,\" Ren Zhengfei, a former engineer in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told CNBC. Digital supremacy In recent weeks, a number of European countries seem to have resisted US lobbying on the issue. Ahead of a government review, due in March or April, the UK's national cyber-security centre has come to the conclusion that any risk posed by Chinese technology can be managed. German chancellor Angela Merkel has called for guarantees on data protection, but not a priori excluded Huawei from the development of Germany's 5G networks. Likewise in Italy, where a member of the government has dismissed American concerns. \"I don't see Huawei as an issue, for me it's just one of 25 names of equipment manufacturers that you can choose from,\" undersecretary of state, Michele Geraci, who oversees international trade and foreign investments at Italy's ministry of economic development\", told Bloomberg. Governments in major European countries thus seem reluctant to side with either the US or China in what has been characterised as a battle for global digital supremacy. European politicians seem to think that American warnings may not be unrelated to an effort to shield tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Amazon from Chinese competitors like Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent. The fight for technological hegemony is therefore not just a question of industry and national security, but also about the power to influence minds and win hearts. \"We should increase China's soft power, give a good Chinese narrative, and better communicate China's message to the world,\" Xi Jinping, CPC's current general secretary, said during the party national congress in 2014. However, the European commission is looking for a solution to ensure that the launching of 5G networks not will lead to the fragmentation of the European common market. Spring summit The commission is expected to table its proposals for a tougher screening regime for foreign investments, mainly targeting China's big state-controlled companies, ahead of the next European summit (21-22 March). \"We have an open market. Everybody who complies with the rules can access it. We have EU procurement rules in place, and we have the investment screening proposal to protect European interests,\" a commission spokesperson told EUobserver, adding that \"EU member states have the right to exclude companies from their markets for national security reasons, if they do not comply with the country's standards and legal framework\". At GSMA's trade fair in Barcelona, which closed on Thursday (28 February), and where Huawei had launched their newest luxury 5G phone, Gabriel sought to reassure the telecommunications industry that political issues raised by the US government would not put a brake to technological innovation. \"Nobody is helped by premature decisions based on partial analysis of the facts,\" the EU commissioner said."}

On its face, the decision is a rebuke of US surveillance practices and a blow to US exporters. But the more enduring effect of this decision may be to isolate not the United States but Europe itself. There is no easy or obvious solution to this crisis, but if the EU cannot find a way to ensure continued data flows, particularly with like-minded allies, Europe risks becoming an island in the digital world. The transatlantic digital economy is deeply integrated, with about that can be supplied digitally. While the United States and Europe have taken divergent approaches to protecting personal data online, a framework called Privacy Shield (and its predecessor, Safe Harbor) has allowed companies to guarantee the protection of European personal data when transferring it to the United States. Thousands of US companies have depended on Privacy Shield. The list includes familiar names like Marriott, lululemon, and Shake Shack, but most are small and medium-sized enterprises. of Alexandria, Virginia, provides marketing software for restaurants. of Harbor City, California sells auto parts over the Internet direct to consumers. These companies collect basic information about their European customers - name, email, and so forth - and transfer that data to the United States for processing and storage. The \"Schrems II\" decision\u2014named for Maximilian Schrems, an Austrian privacy activist who has spent most of the past decade fighting the free flow of European data to the United States\u2014invalidates Privacy Shield, The court's concerns go back to 2013, when Edward Snowden revealed the reach of US domestic surveillance practices. Perhaps more importantly, the Schrems decision on most other legal tools for transferring European data abroad. The global digital economy runs on data, and this decision makes it legally risky to export European data\u2014not just to the United States, but almost anywhere. Suddenly, firms can only confidently transfer European data to countries that have been deemed \"adequate\" by the EU. These \"adequacy determinations,\" which analyse how closely a country's data protection laws resemble the EU's own, typically take years to complete. 25 years, just 12 decisions In 25 years, have received an adequacy determination, a list that includes Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man. Among major digital economies, only Japan has full adequacy (Canada enjoys \"partial adequacy\"); for everyone else, there is no longer solid legal ground on which data can be transferred. With this decision, Europe is sliding toward a system of data localisation in which European data must stay in Europe. Big companies can likely bear the cost of creating redundant data systems in Europe, and for cloud computing providers that already have data centres in Europe (such as Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM), this decision could bring new customers. But many businesses might decide the cost is too great, and instead eschew the European market altogether. Where that happens, European consumers and businesses will suffer. There is no disputing that US authorities have the legal power to compel firms to hand over data. But the United States also has meaningful legal limits on those powers. The situation is : almost all EU member states have laws that allow the government to carry out surveillance in certain circumstances. , for example, gives the state broad authority to monitor phone calls and emails without a warrant, and requires internet companies to collect citizens' data and share it with intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Meanwhile, reforms implemented in the United States since the Snowden revelations have The United Kingdom is experiencing this double standard first-hand. When it was part of the EU, the UK's domestic surveillance programs were its own business: the European Commission has no authority to pry into member states' security practices. Brexit Post-Brexit, the EU is now evaluating the UK's laws, and given the harsh judgment of US rules and practices, it is possible that the UK will be denied adequacy, jeopardising digital trade across the English Channel. Where the rule of law cannot keep data safe, restricting the free flow of data may make sense. Given the deep surveillance state in China and Russia, and the primacy of party over law, there is good reason to believe that personal data transferred to Moscow or Shanghai is neither private nor secure. But lumping the United States, Australia, India, Korea, and potentially the United Kingdom into this same category is nonsensical. And holding other countries to a higher standard than the EU holds its own member states violates a core tenet of the international trading system - a regime to which Europe professes great loyalty. There are no quick fixes to this conundrum: the court's argument is grounded in the EU Charter, and the decision is effectively constitutional. Tinkering with Privacy Shield at the margins is not likely to yield an agreement that will stand up under European judicial scrutiny. The court has effectively demanded that other countries harmonise their laws with Europe's own\u2014and thus become eligible for adequacy\u2014or be cut off from digital trade with the EU. This is impractical and likely self-defeating. When US and EU negotiators hammered out Privacy Shield, they did so because different societies\u2014even those with common values\u2014inevitably take different approaches to addressing the same challenges. Without mechanisms for interoperability, that diversity creates barriers to trade and commerce. While some privacy activists have , the largely theoretical gains for data privacy may come at the cost of very real economic pain. Europe is deeply trade-dependent: its With more and more trade moving to the digital realm, Europe can ill-afford to cut itself off. Meanwhile, China continues to advance a vision for an internet that is fractured along national boundaries and controlled by governments. The Schrems decision, along with Europe's is a double blow in support of this top-down model. Resolving the current crisis will take time and will earnest engagement among governments that seek an open, global digital economy with democratic values at its heart. If Europeans hope to take part in that economy, the EU must opt for interoperability over harmonisation, and must avoid holding other governments to a standard that it cannot hold its own member states. The European and American economies are both built on a foundation of post-War openness and trade\u2014with each other, more than with anyone else.

In tackling the pandemic, we must avoid Europe sleepwalking into a permanent expanded surveillance state. The European Commission guidelines on contact tracing, published last week are a starting point for states to avoid such a path. Developed by EU states with the commission, they contain guidance for member states navigating new methods of data collection in a public health crisis, while reminding them of their existing human rights obligations. This 'common European approach' of standard-setting and oversight, if rolled out properly, could help foster movement of people between EU member states and stimulate economic growth. Rights in times of crisis The proposals state that apps must be in line with the GDPR \u2013 a call that that is not only possible, but necessary. While there are some limited exemptions for business-as-usual GDPR processing in a public health crisis, this is not a free pass for states to ignore existing legal requirements. International human rights law still applies, and any interference with privacy must still be lawful, necessary and proportionate. Amnesty and over 100 other rights groups have laid out some when introducing increased digital surveillance to address the pandemic. The EU guidelines promote human rights and data collection principles \u2013 encouraging a laudable light-touch approach from states, recommending that any apps are voluntary and quickly dismantled once the crisis has passed. But there is a deep confusion and contradiction running through these proposals that sets alarm bells ringing. Decentralised apps for privacy The guidelines launched with a headline recommendation for decentralised contact-tracing apps \u2013 the kind that will apparently be \u2013 which give far less access to personal data to government agencies, and are the right choice when it comes to protecting privacy and other human rights. Yet this recommendation is fast undermined by discussion of the 'limitations' arising from a privacy-first approach. These are guidelines only and contact tracing apps can vary hugely in terms of function and design but the proposals at times seem to advocate for apps that not only connect to a centralised government database, but to allow for a networked pan-European database. This would be a firm step in the wrong direction for human rights. It would open the door for states to access phenomenal new amounts of sensitive information, opportunities to cross-reference previously unlinked data \u2013 not just nationally, but internationally \u2013 which grants governments vast new powers to discriminate based on this information. Contact tracing apps must be limited in scope, with a clearly defined purpose and constraints. There is so much opportunity for mission creep here, with states collecting data 'just in case' or attempting to merge information with existing databases. Any contact tracing app must be subject to rigorous and regular review by independent data protection authorities to ensure that app use is in line with human rights and data protection laws and standards. While they propose only voluntary applications, the guidelines highlight that to be effective, apps should be adopted by over half of the population of member states. One can only hope that states understand this to be an indicator of the limits of contact tracing apps, rather than an encouragement to push on their populations. , the contact tracing programme being held up as an example of good practice, people are mandated to give over extensive amounts of data, a significant concern for human rights. The EU commission must clarify that to protect human rights, any contact tracing apps must be decentralised in approach. To avoid state overreach the guidelines must make explicit what data may be collected under what circumstances, where and how it may be stored and, crucially, what data collection and practices are out of bounds. There is slightly more clarity from now on red lines for contact tracing app data collection, but to what extent are states listening? The common European approach isn't exactly going to plan. to dismantle privacy protections to establish a centralised app. have today opted for decentralised models. hosted a rollercoaster 'app-athon' competition which has thankfully realised the complexity of such an undertaking and concluded that more time is needed, following interventions from Amnesty and others. In order for this technology to work, the public need to trust that it's in their interest to use it. We need to know that any creators, operators and reviewers are acting in our best interests and will protect our human rights both during and beyond the crisis. Particularly during times of emergency we cannot assume that states will do the right thing \u2013 we need transparency at every step of the way. It's still unclear to what extent contact tracing apps can ease pressure on healthcare systems. They are merely one tool that states can use to manage this pandemic, but these apps must be seen in daylight, with all their limitations and flaws, and must never be rolled out at the cost of human rights.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "Contact-tracing apps: a major test for privacy in Europe"}

However, the European Commission and the EU's data protection watchdog back both centralised and decentralised models, as they recognise that the differences are not \"completely clear\". \"Deciding on models that are not clear is not something we should do on policymaking,\" said on the deputy director of the commission's directorate-general for communications networks and technology, Khalil Rouhana, in a videoconference Friday (24 April). Yet, there seems to be an international consensus in favour of the decentralised approach. A group of privacy-minded academics recently developed a fully-decentralised solution (DP3T) for coronavirus contact-tracing apps that keeps data on the user's handset - instead of sending it to a centralised database run by, for example, public health authorities. Google and Apple have also teamed up to develop a decentralised framework for contact-tracing to allow developers to build Covid-19 tracing apps. \"The Google-Apple framework, inspired by DP3T, offers the best privacy-preserving solution while, at the same time, it offers a lot of flexibility, because the app is built by member states and public health authorities,\" said the vice president for engineering at Google, Dave Burke. Both systems have a very similar structure and use bluetooth to track who has been in contact with coronavirus patients since . However, according to Michael Veale, co-developer of the DP3T solution, certain risks apply to all bluetooth contact-tracing solutions (decentralised or not). For example, if the building where a person lives has a very thin wall the system could interpret that this person has been in contact with his or her neighbour when this has not happened. \"This is because bluetooth has not been designed by epidemiologists,\" said Veale, adding that his colleagues are still working on possible solutions to minimise these technical problems. No trust? Conversely, a group of academics and businesses have developed the PEPP-PT (Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing) which seems to have opted for a centralised approach - and it is currently being implemented by German and Italian governments. Also, the European People's Party (EPP) group recently mentioned this solution as one of \"the technical possibilities to collect data anonymously and in accordance with existing EU data protection\". However, nearly 300 leading academics warned in that centralised contact-tracing apps can enable \"unwarranted discrimination and surveillance\", following the release of . According to Gary Davis, who is the global director of privacy & law enforcement requests at Apple, \"it is encouraging that a lot of academics support the DP3T model because it is support for the decentralised system which hopefully is the one that will encourage the user adoption, what it is required to make it [the apps] effective\".

High contagion, many asymptomatic \"There is little evidence available today that would indicate that contact-tracing apps would help curve the spread of the virus. In the context of Covid-19, it is quite difficult to trace contact because this virus involves a high rate of contagion and many infected patients are asymptomatic,\" warned Estelle Mass, a senior policy analyst at NGO Access Now. \"We always must consider the long-term of any decision that is taken during this crisis. When some technologies are deployed is very difficult or, in some cases, impossible to go back,\" she added. Liberal MEP Sophie in 't Veld, from the parliament's committee on civil liberties, has called on the commission to develop a clear legislative framework in addition to the guidelines already announced. \"This [issue] is not only about privacy and data protection, but it is also about harmonisation, interoperability and field of play for providers, among other things,\" she said.

This week, EU leaders are set to sign off on commitments made to bolster the EU\u2019s digital clout in the world, committing to spending 20% of the bloc\u2019s Recovery and Resilience Facility on digital projects.

Also this week: DSA Blacklist, Artificial Intelligence reports, 5G EU threats, Cybersecurity month, Google-Fitbit latest.   EURACTIV recently obtained confidential Commission documents in which officials highlighted why they believe digital identification has become \u2018fundamental\u2019 to the everyday operation of online services. \u201cThere is no user choice for trusted and secure identification that protects personal data and can be widely used,\u201d a Commission presentation obtained by EURACTIV reads, adding that one of the reasons why an EU-wide framework is required is that \u201cthe role of private digital identification services is increasing and platforms take an increasing role.\u201d The documents provide details on the Commission\u2019s vision for the future framework, which should be \u2018universally available\u2019 to all EU citizens and businesses on a voluntary basis, as well as being \u2018universally usable\u2019, and being recognised \u201cby private and public service providers for all transactions that require authentication.\u201d The Commission is dubbing this feature the \u2018EU single sign-on\u2019. At the summit on Friday, EU leaders are set to adopt conclusions urging the Commission to propose a European Digital Identification initiative by mid-2021. In June, EU telecoms ministers called on the Commission to develop an EU-wide digital identity framework, which would \u201cdrive the member states to make widely usable, secure and interoperable digital identities available for all Europeans for secure government and private online transactions.\u201d The latest draft version of the European Council conclusions seen by EURACTIV notes that the initiative should aim to \u201cprovide people with control over their online identity and data as well as to enable access to public, private, and cross-border digital services.\u201d  Blacklist Blacklist .

Parliament reports. Parliament reports. Parliamentary committees are in different stages of adopting their initiative reports on the Digital Services Act, ahead of the Commission\u2019s presentation of the measures before the end of the year. Last Tuesday, members of the Civil Liberties Committee backed EPP MEP Kris Peeters\u2019 text, which supported the notion of maintaining the fundamentals of the eCommerce directive, including the limited liability provisions and the ban on general monitoring obligations. Meanwhile, S&D MEP Alex Agius Saliba\u2019s report in the Internal Market Committee was adopted on Monday. It notes the importance of transparency in seller identifications, as well as reinforcing liability provisions for hosting providers. Moreover, the Legal Affairs Committee also adopted their report on Thursday, with particular attention to the \u2018notice and takedown\u2019 procedure. MEPs ask that when content is flagged or taken down, users should be notified and able to seek redress through a national dispute settlement body. However, a final decision should be taken by an independent judiciary. \u201cWe do not want private companies to police the internet\u201d, said rapporteur S&D\u2019s Tiemo W\u00f6lken after the vote. Breton: Platforms no longer just \u2018hosts.\u2019 Breton: Platforms no longer just \u2018hosts.\u2019 Online platform giants may no longer be defined merely as \u2018hosts,\u2019 the EU\u2019s Internal Market Chief Thierry Breton suggested on Monday (28 September). \u201cThey are no longer just online hosts, but they are vertically integrated and advertising players and that is this how they are gatekeepers,\u201d Breton said. Current EU rules on the definition of hosting providers under the 2000 eCommerce Directive include liability exemptions for such firms included in this scope. Article 14 of the Directive provides that hosting providers are not liable for the content they store, under certain conditions. However, the definition of a hosting provider under the eCommerce Directive has long been a point of contention, and the ambiguity in this respect has given rise to a legal environment by which the European Court of Justice on several occasions has had to determine the text in order to draw its own conclusions on what constitutes a hosting service.  5G delay. 5G delay. EU countries that have not assigned 5G spectrum frequencies by the end of 2020 will be in breach of EU law and could face legal action from the Commission. As part of the EU\u2019s 2016 5G Action Plan, nations committed to developing their next-generation telecommunications infrastructures. These targets included the launch of 5G services in all member states in at least one major city by the end of 2020. Moreover, in the 2018 Electronic Communications Code, the EU pledged to enhance the deployment of 5G networks by ensuring the availability of 5G radio spectrum before the end of this year. EU countries that are yet to formally assign any of the frequencies across the 700 MHz, 3.6 GHz, and 26 GHz bands required for 5G deployment on the bloc, include Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, and Slovenia, according to data from the EU\u2019s 5G Observatory.

The package will cover content and user moderation as well as new competition rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms. The European Commission is due to present the plans in December 2020. Public consultations on the plans are ongoing until 8 September. The Digital Services Act marks the most ambitious attempt yet to rein in the operations of platform giants and, so far, the Commission has suggested that the plans could include measures to crack down on illegal and counterfeit sellers as well as new rules spanning online safety, liability, market dominance, online advertising and smart contracts, issues surrounding self-employment online, and the potential future governance framework for online services. The EU\u2019s Digital 9+1 coalition, including Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, have released a document calling for the Commission\u2019s Digital Services Act package to abide by some of the central principles of the eCommerce directive, including the country of origin principle, the limited liability exemption, and the ban on a general monitoring obligation. In Parliament, three initiative reports have already commenced, from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on Legal Affairs, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Competition Competition Alongside the DSA, the Commission is also attempting to create a level-playing field across the platform economy. Most recently, the EU\u2019s digital chief Margrethe Vestager said that the EU and the US should formulate \u201ccommon visions\u201d on how best to regulate competition in the platform economy. Certain remedies are being mulled over by the executive, including continued competition law enforcement, ex-ante regulation of digital platforms, and a possible new competition tool. As for potential ex-ante regulation of digital gatekeeper platforms, Vestager has shed some light on a series of options, including one possible rule that \u201cprohibits platforms from displaying their own downstream services more prominently than those of rivals.\u201d On regulation of the use of data, Vestager suggests establishing a \u2018data silo\u2019 rule, \u201cwhere a conglomerate platform is prohibited from using specific data sets for certain business purposes in order to prevent it leveraging from one market to another.\u201d Earlier this year, the Commission announced it would unveil a new competition tool before the close of 2020. The tool will be designed to mitigate structural risks in markets as well as intervene in situations whereby a market is close to tipping. Consultations on the measures are ongoing. Online terrorist content & Hate Speech Online terrorist content & Hate Speech Talks between the EU institutions on the online terrorist content regulation have stalled since the coronavirus hit Europe. The plans could potentially see online platforms being forced to remove flagged terrorist content within a one-hour timeframe, in addition to introducing \u2018proactive measures\u2019 such as upload filters. While the Parliament is against the idea of upload filters being included in the text, the Council and Commission both support their inclusion. For their part, the Commission is eager to progress quickly. An official recently told EURACTIV that \u201cfrom our point of view it\u2019s important to make progress quickly because terrorist content online is precisely the sort of activity that doesn\u2019t at all stop in the current situation.\u201d The German Presidency wants negotiations to resume as soon as possible. Nevertheless, with a host of outstanding issues including cross-border removal orders and the role of platforms in flagging and removing content, it is unlikely that talks will conclude anytime soon. Elsewhere, the European Commission has applauded efforts by some of the world\u2019s largest tech platforms in stifling the spread of illegal content, in the last evaluation of the EU\u2019s code on countering illegal hate speech online before the Digital Services Act is presented later this year. Results of the evaluation of the code show that 90% of flagged content was \u2018assessed\u2019 within 24 hours, while 71% of such content was eventually removed. There have been recent developments in the area of online hate speech in France , where the Constitutional Council rejected large parts of a draft law against online hate speech which would have obliged social media giants to remove hateful content within 24 hours. Online abuse Online abuse The European Commission will propose legislation later this year and in 2021 that will force online platforms to undertake measures to stop the spread of online child abuse. As part of rules under the EU\u2019s Electronic Communications Code that come into force in December, the scope of the 2000 e-Commerce Directive will be broadened, having the effect of preventing certain companies from continuing their own measures on the voluntary detection, removal and reporting of child sexual abuse online. Following this initiative, the Commission will put forward further legislation in the second quarter of 2021, to oblige online service providers to \u201cdetect known child sexual abuse material and require them to report that material to public authorities.\u201d Presenting the future plans in July, the EU\u2019s home affairs chief Ylva Johansson also floated the idea of creating a new European centre to prevent and counter child sexual abuse, with a number of responsibilities including proactively searching online content and notifying companies of potential illegalities at play. ///// Data strategy Data strategy The Commission\u2019s data strategy, presented in February 2020, aims to establish a single European market for data, allowing public and private actors \u201ceasy access\u201d to huge reserves of industrial information. The strategy features work produced under four pillars covering the governance model for the access, use and reuse of such data, capacity building for Europe\u2019s data ecosystem, empowering businesses and individuals in their knowledge of how data can benefit them, and also the specific establishment of data spaces across a range of sectors. Plans that the Commission has thus far put forward include the creation of nine common EU data spaces across sectors including healthcare, agriculture and energy, as well as the establishment of a Data Act in 2021, that could \u201cfoster business-to-government data sharing for the public interest.\u201d Feedback on a public consultation that concluded earlier this year has recently been published by the Commission and can be found here . S&D MEP Miapetra Kumpula-Natri, rapporteur in the European Parliament for the Industry Committee\u2019s report on the EU Data Strategy, recently noted her general thoughts on the plans, highlighting the importance of common guidelines for cross-sectoral data flows, and also pitching the establishment of a data governance body. Later in the year, a legislative framework on common European data spaces will be presented by the Commission, and an implementing act on a list of high-value datasets will come forth in 2021. Gaia-X Gaia-X Meanwhile, honing in on Europe\u2019s cloud dataspace, in June, France and Germany\u2019s launched their ambitious bid to create a European cloud data infrastructure to stave off US and Chinese competitors. The Gaia-X initiative will set European standards for data storage and also function as a platform for businesses to search for data storage providers, in addition to offering a secure environment for the cross-business sharing of data in Europe. ePrivacy ePrivacy Nearly four years on, negotiations in the Council on the EU\u2019s bid to protect data transmitted over electronic communications as part of the e-Privacy regulation continues. In mid-July national delegations were consulted as part of a Council Telecoms working party on how best to move forward with the plans, particularly in the context of the German Presidency\u2019s hopes of reaching an agreement before the end of the year. The German Presidency stated that agreement on Articles 6 to 6d and Article 8 is necessary to move forward. Article 6 of the plans covers the accessing of metadata without the users\u2019 consent while Article 8 hones in on the protection of end-users\u2019 terminal equipment information. Privacy Shield Privacy Shield The EU-US Privacy Shield agreement that attempts to guarantee the secure transmission of EU data to the United States, was declared invalid by the European Court of Justice, in a ruling that will provoke major disruption to transatlantic data flows. The ruling by Europe\u2019s highest court found that the scope and pervasiveness of the US surveillance framework does not allow for a sufficient degree of protection for European data, putting it at risk of violating rights afforded to citizens under the EU\u2019s general data protection regulation (GDPR). Read more here . Since the strike down was made, it has transpired that the US Commerce Department and the European Commission have commenced talks on building a new privacy shield agreement. However, there are those that feel that the reach of the US\u2019s surveillance regime will never allow for a truly safe transmission of EU data to the country. For his part, Austrian Privacy activist Max Schrems, a defendant in the recent privacy shield case, hopes that there could be a push for surveillance law reform in the US, subsequent to the ECJ\u2019s ruling. ///// Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence In February 2020, the Commission published its Artificial Intelligence White Paper, in which a series of \u2018high-risk\u2019 technologies were earmarked for future oversight, including those in \u2018critical sectors\u2019 and those deemed to be of \u2018 critical use .\u2019 Subsequent to the presentation of the paper, a consultation was launched which closed on 14 June. Concerns submitted in response to the consultation included the use of biometric technology in AI tech, to the operation of Automated Decision Making (ADM) software. However, stakeholders supporting a softer-regulatory approach have hit out at the Commission\u2019s intentions to produce conformity assessments for high-risk Artificial Intelligence applications. The Commission will present a follow-up to the White Paper, including on safety, liability, fundamental rights and data in Q1 2021. Commissioner Vestager has, for her part, recently spoken of her opposition to certain Artificial Intelligence applications, including forms of predictive policing. Cybersecurity Cybersecurity In late July, the European Union imposed travel and financial sanctions on a department of Russia\u2019s military intelligence service and on firms from North Korea and China over their suspected participation in major cyberattacks across the world. This came as the European Commission presented its new Security Union strategy , which included measures to bolster cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure as well as preparing the bloc for emerging threats in \u201creal and digital\u201d environments. Moreover, a new cybersecurity strategy is foreseen in light of the various cyberattacks that hit hospitals across the EU. You may recall that Commission President von der Leyen suggested that China may have been behind the offensive. The new cybersecurity strategy was included in the Commission\u2019s recovery plans presented earlier this year. The EU executive says it \u201cwill look at how to boost EU-level cooperation, knowledge and capacity. It will also help Europe strengthen its industrial capabilities and partnerships, and encourage the emergence of SMEs in the field.\u201d The Commission has also stated that a proposal for \u201cadditional measures on Critical Infrastructure Protection\u201d will be put forward later this year. Moreover, a review of the Directive on security of network and information systems will also come in Q4 this year, and EURACTIV was recently informed that there is likely to be a potential widening in the scope of operators of essential services. ///// 5G 5G Current goals in the field include a launch of 5G services in all EU member states by the end of 2020 at the latest, as well as a \u2018rapid build-up\u2019 that will ensure \u201cuninterrupted 5G coverage in urban areas and along main transport paths by 2025,\u201d as outlined in the 2016 5G Action Plan for Europe. In May, Vestager urged EU telecoms ministers to \u201climit as much as possible\u201d any delays to their 5G spectrum assignments. As part of a series of measures unveiled by the Commission in January\u2019s 5G Toolbox, member states were tasked with assessing the risk profile of telecom providers, with a view to applying restrictions for those vendors considered to be high-risk. A progress report on the plans, presented by the Commission towards the end of July, found that EU nations must make urgent progress on mitigating the risks to 5G telecommunications networks posed by certain high-risk suppliers. The call comes at a time when Washington continues to ramp up pressure on the EU to ban Chinese telecoms provider Huawei, following recent moves in the UK and France to limit the company\u2019s involvement in their 5G infrastructure. The Commission, alongside the member states and the EU\u2019s cyber agency, ENISA, will continue to monitor compliance with the 5G toolbox, with a view to potentially analysing the need for stricter security baselines to be recommended at EU level in the future. ///// The Budget and Recovery Fund The Budget and Recovery Fund In July, EU leaders reached a \u2018historic agreement\u2019 on the new multi-annual financial framework and the recovery and resilience fund. However, in order to achieve these new agreements, substantial cuts have been made to the bloc\u2019s various funding programs, including in digital fields. As things stand, below you will find a short breakdown of what is on offer in the digital arena. Bear in mind, however, that Parliament is still to sign off on the long-term budget, and the house still has a number of concerns . Should Parliament not approve the plans, the recovery fund could also be impacted. Horizon Europe Horizon Europe is the bloc\u2019s research and innovation funding framework and while there has been an increase from the previous MFF, some will question whether it is sufficient in a radically new global context. However, the plan is in line for a \u20ac5bn increase under the recovery fund. The Connecting Europe facility Connecting Europe facility is designed to foster an \u201cup-to-date, high-performance infrastructure to help connect and integrate the Union and all its regions, in the transport, energy and digital sectors.\u201d In terms of the digital branch of the programme, the recovery fund will not contribute anything, but the MFF allocation is doubled from the previous long-term budget. The figures are, however, very small when analysed in the context of other comprehensive infrastructure programmes, including China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative, which has plans to enter the EU through Italy. Digital Europe Digital Europe will invest in key strategic digital capacities such as the EU\u2019s high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Despite being reduced from the Commission\u2019s 27 May proposal of \u20ac8.2bn, the new figures are still considerably higher than the previous MFF, with the programme receiving \u20ac6.76bn. Digital Tax Digital Tax Meanwhile, in terms of funding the post-Covid-19 recovery, the European Council has put forward several \u2018own resources\u2019 proposals, which include a levy on digital giants \u2013 an option very amenable to European Parliamentarians. In the Council conclusions, EU heads of state tasked the Commission with coming up with a proposal on the Digital Tax in Q1 2021, should there be no international agreement by that date. However, EU efforts could be stymied by the fact that agreements on tax policy require unanimity in the Council, which thwarted progress last year on the digital tax plans previously presented by the Commission. Attempts to introduce a bloc-wide digital services tax faltered following opposition led by Ireland, Finland and Sweden to a planned 3% levy on companies earning \u20ac750 million in revenue,   \u20ac50 million of which would need to be EU taxable revenue. For its part, Parliament has long supported the idea of a digital services tax. French President Emmanuel Macron told French TV that he envisages an EU-wide levy on big tech multinationals, along the lines of a digital tax, which France plans to impose this year. Macron\u2019s comments, made on 21 July, came after he backed down earlier this year on levying hefty taxes on some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names in January , following US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats. ///// Democracy Action Plan Democracy Action Plan In mid-July, the Commission launched public consultations on its \u2018Democracy Action Plan, which the executive is due to put forth before the close of 2020. The plans aim to safeguard against external interference and manipulation in elections, media freedom and pluralism and the fight against disinformation. The public consultation closes on 15 September. As part of the feedback period, the Commission placed a particular focus on areas covering the transparency of political ads online, tackling disinformation, and protecting media freedom, independence and pluralism. In this context, a July report backed by the Commission found that it is of the \u2018 utmost importance \u2019 for the EU to do more to rein in the unregulated environment of online political advertising by establishing more stringent transparency obligations. In addition, announcing a raft of new funding plans to promote media freedom and pluralism in Europe in March, the Commission\u2019s Vice-President for Values and Transparency, Vera Jourova, said that the \u2018 key objective\u2019 of the European Democracy Action Plan is to \u201cstrengthen media freedom and pluralism.\u201d The precise scope and content of the Action Plan is also dependent on the Digital Service Act proposal. ///// Digital Education Action Plan Digital Education Action Plan In late July, the EU\u2019s Innovation and Research Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said that developing digital competencies across the EU as well as promoting gender equality in the bloc\u2019s digital economy are two key areas that the Commission will seek to foster as part of the forthcoming revamped Digital Education Action Plan. \u201cThe overall objective will be to close the digital skills gap and make digital literacy a reality for all,\u201d Gabriel said on the plans, which are expected to be published late September. A public consultation is open until 4 September. At the beginning of July, the EU executive laid out ambitious new goals for upskilling and reskilling the bloc by 2025, including the objective of ensuring that 70% of the EU adult population has basic digital skills. The benchmark is part of the Commission\u2019s revised European Skills Agenda published on Wednesday (7 July), along with the Youth Employment Support Package. The 70% target is a 24% mark-up from 2019 figures. The announcement followed the recent publication of the Commission\u2019s Digital Economy and Society Index, which found that a large part of the EU population \u201clacks basic digital skills, even though most jobs require such skills.\u201d More broadly, there has been no shortage of lawmakers in Brussels highlighting the fact that the economic struggle brought on by the coronavirus only serves to underline the importance of boosting the bloc\u2019s digital skills. Earlier this year, EURACTIV caught up with Victor Negrescu, rapporteur for the Culture Committee\u2019s report on the EU digital education strategy, who said just this. Read the interview here .

EU leaders reached a \u2018historic agreement\u2019 earlier this week on the new multi-annual financial framework and the recovery and resilience fund. However, in order to achieve these new agreements, substantial cuts have been made to the bloc\u2019s various funding programs, including in the digital fields. This week, we crunch the numbers in detail and also look at the other big stories in EU politics and policy, in the tech patch.  *Also this week* *Also this week* Digital Tax latest, Huawei in France, Slack Vs Microsoft, Hungary media crackdown, Russian UK election interference, Apple\u2019s vein matching technology, and more\u2026.   MEPs were quick to lament the cuts to various EU digital programs, following an agreement on the EU\u2019s new multi-annual financial framework (MFF) and the recovery and resilience fund (RRF). In the digital domain, there are three frameworks worth analysing: Horizon Europe, Digital Europe and the Connecting Europe Facility Digital branch. We\u2019ve followed the changes over recent months, looking at the numbers in comparison with the previous MFF, in addition to how they stack up against previous Commission proposals.   Horizon Europe Horizon Europe is the bloc\u2019s research and innovation funding framework and while there has been an increase from the previous MFF, some will question whether it is sufficient in a radically new global context. However, the plan also comes in for a \u20ac5bn increase under the recovery fund. The Connecting Europe facility Connecting Europe facility is designed to foster an \u201cup-to-date, high-performance infrastructure to help connect and integrate the Union and all its regions, in the transport, energy and digital sectors.\u201d In terms of the digital branch of the programme, the recovery fund will not contribute anything, but the MFF allocation is doubled from the previous long-term budget.

Digital Europe Digital Europe will invest in key strategic digital capacities such as the EU\u2019s high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Under the previous MFF, the funding allocation was only \u20ac169m. Despite being reduced from the Commission\u2019s May 27 proposal of \u20ac8.2bn, the new figures are still considerably higher than the previous MFF, with the programme receiving \u20ac6.76bn. Meanwhile, in terms of funding the recovery, the European Council has put forward several \u2018own resources\u2019 proposals, which include a levy on digital giants \u2013 an option very amenable to European Parliamentarians.

One of the major shifts is contained in these few words, which speak of the EU\u2019s own resources, because in seven years time, when we negotiate the next budget, this will be a key thing,\u201d Jan\u0161a said on Tuesday (21 July). He highlighted digital taxation as probably the EU\u2019s biggest potential \u2018own resource\u2019 in the future and said that taxation of emissions and plastics is a problem for those countries that have already included these resources in their national tax policy.

Work-communications platform Slack has filed a competition complaint to the European Commission against Microsoft, which stands accused of tying in its Teams products into its \u2018market-dominant\u2019 Office productivity suite, at the disadvantage of rival Slack products. For their part, Microsoft suggested that Slack\u2019s complaint may be due to a sense of bitterness over their lack of video-conferencing software to offer consumers. \u201cWith COVID-19, the market has embraced Teams in record numbers while Slack suffered from its absence of video-conferencing,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to offering customers not only the best of new innovation but a wide variety of choice in how they purchase and use the product.\u201d Italy Amazon-Apple probe.

As part of a coordinated campaign, nine European members of the Civil Liberties Union for Europe are filing freedom of information requests to national authorities on Monday (8 June), in a bid to ensure that governments are abiding by EU data protection legislation. The organisations coming from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden, say they want to ensure that governments are not processing more personal data than what is necessary in the bloc\u2019s contact tracing efforts, and that member states are also minimising the risk of data leakage and privacy violations. \u201cWhile the aim of saving lives and livelihoods is without doubts salutary, the path of mass surveillance is quite possibly unnecessary and surely dangerous to take,\u201d Orsolya Reich, senior advocacy officer at Liberties, said in a statement. \u201cHuman rights organisations need to make sure that European governments take their responsibility to prepare impact assessments seriously and no European government uses the pandemic as a pretext for normalising the expanded use of invasive digital surveillance technologies.\u201d Moreover, in an effort to implore national authorities to comply with the freedom of information requests, members involved in the initiative also threaten to \u2018 start litigation against those member states that fail to provide all public data related to the applications, or where data protection regulations are breached.\u2019 Despite the harsh tone, however, Liberties did in fact say that they understood how such a campaign could drain the resources of national authorities at a time when many governmental departments are operating at a minimal level. As part of a series of measures recently announced by the European Commission under its mid-May transport and tourism package, designed to assist in easing Europe\u2019s coronavirus lockdown restrictions, the executive stated that the \u201clargest possible participation\u201d of EU citizens is required in order for coronavirus contact tracing applications to work effectively.

Newly obtained documents, released under a series of freedom of information requests, reveal details of Palantir\u2019s involvement in the EU. The news comes following a recent EURACTIV investigation which revealed that Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had met the CEO of Palantir at Davos in January, but that the executive had kept no notes of what was discussed in the meeting. MEP In\u2018t Veld penned a letter to the Commission on Thursday (10 June), calling for more information on several key developments in the relationship between Palantir and EU organisations over recent years. The US big data analytics firm became infamous following a 2018 partnership agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in which the company was contracted to deploy its Investigative Case Management (ICM) system, used as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to deport millions of immigrants from the US. It has also been previously alleged that Palantir worked with Cambridge Analytica, the political analytics firm that illegally obtained the personal data of around 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge. Around 2.7 million of those users were EU-based. And several MEPs from both the Liberal and Green groups, have told EURACTIV this week that they fear a potential repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, unless more reassurances of Palantir\u2019s operations in the EU are made clear.

CREATING 'SMART CITIES' The transformation of a city into 'a smart model' takes into account several factors, but energy is the key one, as Rub\u00e9n Garcia, MySmartLife project coordinator, explained. \"The goal of these projects is about working on the sustainability and the resilience of the cities. Our cities are obviously a very large energy consumer. Most of us live in cities and here we have problems when it comes to supplying clean energy. What they are promoting in this kind of project is the development of very innovative pioneer programs towards this energy transition.\" The municipality of Palencia has now replaced 57% of its total street lighting network with LED technology. Building and sharing these sort of interconnected sustainable projects pave the way for future urban strategies. Mario Simon Martin, mayor of Palencia, backs the project. \"We now have an obligation to start visualising the city to be the way we want it in 2030. A city where all these projects will be completed, and a city that continues to work to b a friendly city, where the quality of life is being improved,\" he added. The EU has a goal - to make one hundred cities carbon neutral by 2030 as part of its Horizon Europe program that will be launched next year. In this week's special edition of Futuris on Euronews, we look at what is being done to reach that target. BUILDING A GREENER FUTURE Sustainable development of urban areas is a challenge of key importance to keep carbon emissions down. It requires new, efficient, and user-friendly technologies and services, in particular in the areas of energy, transport and ICT. However, these solutions need integrated approaches, both in terms of research and development of advanced technological solutions, as well as deployment. Valladolid is one of the 'lighthouse' cities that has been chosen to experiment with innovations and lead the way for other cities to replicate what works. The new ideas are being implemented within the framework of the EU project Remourban , which brings together various initiatives. Miguel Angel Garcia-Fuentes is a project coordinator for Remourban and talked us through some of the things being done. \"We have implemented actions in many areas, like making buildings more energy efficient, creating sustainable mobility, and implemented information and communication technologies. In terms of mobility, we have a charging infrastructure that has sixty-three charging points around the city. \"We have also added forty five electric vehicles to various last-mile delivery fleets within the city, plus two electric buses, and another three additional ones that the city council has incorporated,\" he added. MAKING CITIES 'CLIMATE NEUTRAL' Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, who is chair of the climate-neutral and smart cities mission, explained why the project to make cities smart and carbon neutral is so important. \"Cities cover about 3% of Earth and they produce about 72% of global greenhouse gas emissions. So the cities are exactly the place where we can make an impact and influence changing the climate to make it neutral. Because mobility, housing, waste, these are all issues which can be tackled by reducing the emission of the gas. \"Our goal is mainly to support, to promote, and to showcase one hundred cities in Europe, and help them in the transformation process towards climate neutrality,\" she added.

Nature Based Solutions A growing number of European cities are turning to what are being termed Nature Based Solutions to improve urban climate and water resilience. Eindhoven , along with Tampere in Finland and Genoa in Italy is at the forefront of cities that are trying new strategies within the European UNaLab project .

To cope with these problems, the strategy is to increase the amount of green areas, including bodies of water. This approach makes it even easier - and less costly - to maintain these public areas. Luuk Postmes, the Unalab Project Manager in Eindhoven, said the evidence supports their approach: \"What we find out is that nature based solutions work pretty well for us, because they improve the 'liveability' of the city and we have some big advantages.

The authorities in Eindhoven have recently applied these concepts at a square in the city centre, where trees and grass have been planted on what was previously a stone-covered area. Delia Mitcan, Eindhoven's Smart Cities Project Coordinator says it's a much more efficient and sustainable approach: \"The square was totally paved before and all the greenery that's been put into this square is meant to stimulate the biodiversity, to stimulate a more liveable situation for the citizens - and to use the rainwater in a more innovative and a smarter way\" Other projects have included gardens with water storage systems to collect rain, which can then be used for watering plants and grass. Green areas have multiple advantages, not least the creation of a pleasant and healthier environment for the local residents. Urban habitats as living organisms Theo Hoppenbrouwers, from the Council's Neighbourhoods Committee, says it's a way of dealing with a changing climate: \"The stress of the heat in the summertime is too much and we are not used to that in Holland. So the environment is not that nice to live in, in summertime. And if you can change that with flowers and the trees, then that will help to cool it down\". Milan Koelen is a local resident and film maker who says the centre of the city has altered for the better: \"The park has changed completely.

Last week, the French government postponed a debate on the tracing app project after many questions were raised over privacy issues. The French Prime Minister suggested that the app would be submitted to a specific vote but no date has been set yet. \"Questions concerning civil liberties seem to me to be well-founded. They have to be asked and discussed\", Edouard Philipe told MPs on 27 April. The app has been criticised by many, including MPs from the ruling party \"En Marche\". Cedric O said on Tuesday that the government had declined digital solutions offered by Google and Apple to develop the app, citing \"a certain number of issues in terms of privacy and interconnection with the health system\". \"It is due to these concerns, and not because we see Apple and Google as big bad wolves, that we refused to use their technology,\" O said. \"We will have an app that will work well on all smartphones,\" he added. \"The fight against coronavirus is the role of the states, not necessarily that of US digital giants.\" How can these apps be useful? Health agencies believe mobile phones can help efforts to track who COVID-19-infected people have been in contact with. Over a dozen apps are in development across Europe. The EU has called for the projects to be harmonised, but the continent is divided on how to align the technology\u2019s potential with privacy concerns. A pan-European initiative to develop a common framework, PEPP-PT, has been abandoned by Switzerland and Spain over where data is stored. Germany has also dropped out and ditched plans for a homegrown app. Instead, it\u2019s looking to technology giants Apple and Google for support. Belgium was an early proponent of contact tracing apps. On Friday, telecommunications minister Philippe De Backer said an app release had been cancelled and the government would opt for manual, human tracing. How do such apps work? Each software is different in design \u2013 but trace in similar ways. Bluetooth signals keep track of anonymous devices that we come in contact with for more than a few minutes. Running in the background, the app generates an anonymous, numerical ID. That number is exchanged with other mobile phones running the app. If someone later tests positive, those numerical IDs are anonymously red-flagged. Anyone who\u2019s crossed paths is told to isolate, but the app doesn\u2019t reveal details about where and when the suspected transmission took place. Unlike similar technology in China, GPS and Wifi features are disabled so that location data is not recorded. What are the security concerns over the app? Many are still sceptical about implementing this type of technology at the state level. Les R\u00e9publicains, a conservative political party in France, has expressed concern about how the data could be used after the crisis. And it is not only political parties, there is a pattern of general concern surrounding people's data being surrendered in a good cause and then being used for non-essential purposes later. \u201cWe need to be careful. There\u2019s legal precedent that we could be establishing now with this framework, and it could later be expanded to other areas,\u201d said French MP Philippe Gosselin. Designers admit that even with the most complex high-tech app, existing precautions like social distancing and frequent hand washing need to continue to keep the virus under control.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "StopCOVID: France's controversial tracing app ready by June, government says"}

It has had a tIdal management system in place since 1501 and the oldest meteorological station is in Punta della Dogana. It is still operational and has a new ally: I-STORMS. I-STORMS I-STORMS is a European project that aims to improve the early warning and civil protection procedures in sea storm emergencies. It does this through transnational cooperation to enhance innovative policies and develop joint strategies to safeguard the Adriatic-Ionian area from sea storms. The I-STORMS Web System is a combination of a common data system for sharing ocean measurements and forecasts, a multi-model forecasting system, a geoportal and an interactive geo-visualisation tool to make results available to the general public too. Greece, Albania, Slovenia and Croatia share the same concerns and are also part of the project. Before it, each country had its own method, now the data is shared. With a budget of 1.4 million euros, I-STORMS is largely funded by the EU Cohesion Policy. FORWARD PLANNING Planning in time for a sea storm can be a life-saver. The high water, or Aqua Alta , has become a nightmare for many residents, including Paolo, who owns a hotel near San Marcos. \"On 12 November 2019 we had 187cm. That meant we had 60cm of water inside the hotel so it almost reached the electrical outlets. We would need the Mose project to work. The barriers, we invested billions of euros in them for state of the art protection,\" Paolo Sartore said. The Mose project is a system of barriers for the protection of Venice from high tides. However, in order to better predict and manage alerts, I-STORMS has made wave, wind and tide data available to everyone in real time, with an application developed by researchers from Christian Ferrarin's team. \"The application presents a map where we can select any location in the Adriatic and Ionian basin and at that point, we can see the levels and how they will evolve over a couple of days, and also the waves. It is useful for everybody in the sense that it is for people but also for civil protection systems that have to manage the alert and the emergency management,\" ISMAR-CNR researcher, Christian Ferrarin, said.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "How a new EU project is helping cities like Venice manage flood risk"}

When nurse Maria Alexeyeva contracted COVID-19 at work, she isolated herself at home and followed the rules set by the Moscow authorities. She checked in with doctors regularly, did not leave her apartment and downloaded the app. The app, called Social Monitoring, tracks users via GPS and sends them notifications at random times demanding a selfie to prove they're home. If it detects they've left or if they fail to provide a photo to prove it, patients can be fined \u20ac50 each time. But the app crashed when Alexeyeva tried to take a photo, as she kept struggling with the software for days. Sometimes she would spend hours on the phone trying to contact the app user support service. When her quarantine came to an end, she discovered she had stacked up fines for over \u20ac550. \u201cThat\u2019s more than my monthly wage,\u201d Alexeyeva complained. \u201cThis quarantine has been hard on me. And now I have to deal with this too.\u201d Authorities say fines are justified, while users file thousands of complaints Thousands of Muscovites are complaining they were mistakenly fined by the app. In just over a month, authorities issued some 54,000 fines, racking up over \u20ac2.6 million among its nearly 70,000 registered users. By the end of May, authorities got over 2,500 complaints, and more than 200 appeals were filed. Euronews' Russian team collected further negative feedbacks on the App Store. \"Constantly asking for a picture, I take a photo, and it returns again to the identification menu! It's endless!\" \"The technical support recommends restarting the phone again. With temperature and poor health, endless calls from Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing) and the clinic, it is simply impossible to dial up the technicians every time, dictate your data and describe the same thing. Nerves stretched to the limit.\" Authorities insist the fines were justified as they were issued to those who repeatedly violated quarantine. But the users say the app has glitches and flaws - sometimes demanding selfies in the middle of the night - and claim that the fines were dished out arbitrarily. Moscow has been Russia's hardest-hit city during the pandemic, recording nearly half of the country's more than 414,000 cases. The Social Monitoring app was rolled out in early April and was mandatory for those infected with the virus or suspected of having it. Patients had to sign a form requiring them to install the app as part of their quarantine procedures, although they said they were not told how to use the app or what actions would be fined. Euronews obtained from journalist Alexander Murashev the form he received with the instructions for his self-confinement. There is only a small paragraph mentioning the app, which Murashev was not able to read due to his illness. Furthermore, he got fined for not using the app over a period where it hadn't even been released, he told us. 'I don't understand what I'm paying for' Grigory Sakharov, who self-isolated after a week in the hospital with coronavirus-induced pneumonia, was given six fines, totalling over \u20ac300. Two dated back to when he was still hospitalized, even though he didn't install the app until after his discharge. \u201cI don\u2019t mind paying a fine if I do something wrong, but I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m paying for here,\u201d Sakharov said. Svetlana Bystrova, quarantined at home with flu-like symptoms, didn\u2019t install the app. She said her doctors didn\u2019t tell her she had to, and she didn\u2019t notice a clause requiring her to use the app in the quarantine order she signed. After two weeks of strict self-isolation, Bystrova found she had been fined four times. The first time it was for not installing the app, the other two times because the app found she was outside her apartment, and the last time without giving any detail. \u201cThe one for not installing the app I get, fair enough,\u201d Bystrova said. \u201cBut how can the app I never installed track my movements?\u201d Activists urge Moscow to drop the app claiming it violates privacy Three online petitions demanding to abolish the app got over 94,000 signatures. Tanya Lokshina, associate director for Human Rights Watch\u2019s Europe and Central Asia, says that \u201cthe situation is absurd and insane.\" \u201cInstead of containing the epidemic, it punishes those citizens who actually attempt to play by the rules.\u201d On May 21, Human Rights Watch urged Moscow authorities to drop the app, noting that on top of the arbitrary fines, Social Monitoring violated users' privacy by accessing their location, calls, camera, network information and other data. Russia\u2019s Presidential Human Rights Council echoed HRW's stance, urging officials to cancel all fines. But Alexei Nemeryuk, the mayor's deputy chief of staff, said there will be no amnesty, noting that \u201cthere's a system that allows appealing the fines.\u201d That has proved unsuccessful, according to Leonid, from the Solovyov of the Apologia Protesta legal aid group. Leonid, who is working to help over 100 people that were fined, said those who are fined must provide proof they did nothing wrong, which is difficult, while authorities are issuing fines based only on data from the app. Moscow City Hall however said it was cancelling 468 fines for failing to take a selfie because the app made those requests in the middle of the night. Another high-profile case involved Irina Karabulatova, a bed-ridden professor who hasn\u2019t left her apartment in a year and got two fines for not installing the app. After her story made national headlines, the fines were cancelled and officials apologized.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "Coronavirus: Russia's tracking app sparks fury after mistakenly fining users"}

The technology is used to identify and locate people from a digital image or a video frame. It's used by many countries around the world, most notably for border-check purposes, but also to prevent knife and gun crime as well as child and sexual exploitation . Amazon is the latest tech giant to step back from letting police use its technology, which has faced criticism for incorrectly identifying people with darker skin. But the company said that organisations that use its tool, called Rekognition, to help find children who are missing or sexually exploited, will still have access to the technology. Ongoing protests following the death of George Floyd have focused attention on racial injustice and how police use technology to track people. Amazon itself expressed support for the fight against \"the brutal treatment of Black people\". George Floyd died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed black man\u2019s neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleaded for air. Law enforcement agencies use facial recognition to identify suspects, but critics say it can be misused. A number of US cities have banned its use by police and other government agencies, led by San Francisco last year. On Tuesday, IBM said it would get out of the facial recognition business, noting concerns about how the technology can be used for mass surveillance and racial profiling. It\u2019s not clear at the moment if the ban on police use includes federal law enforcement agencies. Civil rights groups and Amazon's own employees have pushed the company to stop selling its technology to government agencies, saying that it could be used to invade privacy and target people of colour. In a blog post on Wednesday , Amazon said that it hoped Congress would put in place stronger regulations for facial recognition. Clare Garvie, a researcher at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology, said: \"Amazon\u2019s decision is an important symbolic step, but this doesn\u2019t really change the face recognition landscape in the United States since it\u2019s not a major player.\" Garvie's research found only two US agencies are using or testing Rekognition. The Orlando police department tested it, but chose not to implement it, she said. While the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Oregon, which has been the most public about using Rekognition, said it was suspending its use indefinitely after Amazon's announcement. Studies led by MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini found racial and gender disparities in facial recognition software. Those findings spurred Microsoft and IBM to improve their systems but irked Amazon, which last year publicly attacked her research methods. A group of artificial intelligence scholars last year launched a spirited defence of her work and called on Amazon to stop selling its facial recognition software to police. A study carried last year by a US agency affirmed concerns about the technology's flaws. The National Institute of Standards and Technology tested leading facial recognition systems -- though not from Amazon, which didn't submit its algorithms -- and found that they often performed unevenly based on a person\u2019s race, gender or age. Buolamwini on Wednesday called Amazon\u2019s announcement a \u201cwelcomed though unexpected announcement.\u201d \u201cMicrosoft also needs to take a stand,\u201d she said. \u201cMore importantly our lawmakers need to step up\u201d to rein in harmful deployments of the technologies. This week's announcements by Amazon and IBM follow a push by Democratic lawmakers to pass a sweeping police reform package in Congress that could include restrictions on the use of facial recognition, especially in police body cameras. Though not commonly used in the US, the possibility of cameras that could monitor crowds and identify people in real-time has attracted bipartisan concern.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "Amazon bans police use of its face recognition tool for a year"}

Here's why Mark Zuckerberg's platform now scares me \u01c0 View", "content": "Opinion piece by Robert McNamee A dystopian technology future overran our lives before we were ready. As a result, we now face issues for which there are no easy answers without much time to act. We embraced the smartphone as a body part without understanding that there would be a downside. We trusted internet platforms to be benign. We reacted too slowly to warning signs. In the eighties and nineties, the philosopher Neil Postman warned us that television had ushered in Aldous Huxley\u2019s \"Brave New World.\" Where Orwell worried about the burning of books, Huxley argued that the greater risk would be citizens no longer wanting to read. Postman predicted that television would entertain us to death. He did not live to see the smartphone prove his argument with an exclamation point. Technology vendors have too many advantages over users. We cannot resist the allure of smartphones. Internet platforms apply their networks, design skills, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to capture our attention and hold it. They exploit the weakest links in human psychology to create dependence and behavioral addiction. Heavy doses of fun and dopamine keep us hooked and make us vulnerable. It happens to toddlers, grade schoolers, preteens, teens, and adults. Not everyone who is online is addicted. Not everyone has been manipulated. But no one can escape the consequences of these addictions and manipulations, as they affect enough people to undermine even the most successful countries. If we are to be a functioning democracy, we cannot allow the present situation to continue. If we want our kids to grow up to be functioning adults, we must force change. If we adults want to preserve agency over our lives, we have to stand up. Next- generation technology from the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence will compound the current problems if we do not take action now. As users, we have more power than we realize. Internet platforms need us. They need our attention. When we give it, they have enormous \u2014 sometimes decisive \u2014 influence on our lives. Today the platforms\u2019 reach is mostly limited to smartphones. Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Home are expanding the footprint, followed by cars, TVs, refrigerators, toys, and other devices. We will increasingly be surrounded by devices that listen, watch, and record everything we do. The resulting data will then be processed by artificial intelligence and algorithms that will manipulate our attention and behavior in ways that create economic value for platform owners. Today we have some control over the degree to which IoT devices influence our life because most of us are not yet using them. Take the time to consider the dark side of any new technology before embracing its convenience. Our voice and our choices will be decisive. We can go along like sheep, or we can insist on a new model: human- driven technology. Individually, we struggle to resist, but collectively, we have great power. To exercise that power, we must leave our digital cocoon to interact with friends, neighbors, and total strangers. Engaging with a wide range of opinions is essential for democracy. The U.S. has forgotten the essential value of compromise, which starts with listening to and acknowledging the legitimacy of different points of view. If we are to break out of filter bubbles and preference bubbles \u2014 whether online or off \u2014 we need to invest the time necessary to be better informed. We need to be appropriately skeptical about what we read, watch, and hear, applying critical thinking to content from all sources, seeking out different perspectives, and validating content before we share it. The bibliographic essay at the end of this book includes sources you can use to investigate the quality of publishers and validity of content. Forcing Silicon Valley to embrace human-driven technology would offer giant benefits to society but may require an effort analogous to the long campaign against smoking. We hate to think about the harm internet platforms are inflicting on us. Making the changes necessary to stop internet addiction, election interference, and privacy invasions will be hard work. It would be so much more pleasant to play another round of Candy Crush or check Instagram. I get it. My own journey from cheerleader to activist has been a struggle. I have had to face unpleasant facts about platforms in which I have been an investor and advisor, as well as about my own usage of technology. It has not made me popular in Silicon Valley, but it had to be done. There are times that require each of us do the right thing, no matter the cost. For me, this is one of those times. How about you? Are you concerned about children getting addicted to texting or video games? Do you worry about all the kids who cannot put down their smartphones or video games? Have you known a preteen girl who has been body shamed online or a teen who has suffered from fear of missing out? Do you worry about the consequences of foreign countries interfering in our elections? Do you wonder about the moral implications of American products being used to promote ethnic cleansing in other countries? Do you have trepidation about constant surveillance? Are you concerned about being manipulated by artificial intelligence? These are not hypothetical questions. Here is some good news: internet platforms respond to pressure. We know this from recent experience. We collectively stimulated enough pressure that Facebook implemented much better rules for election advertising and Google announced humane design features in its new smartphone. These first steps never would have happened in the absence of public pressure. And each of us can exert at least two forms of pressure: we can change our behavior online and we can demand that politicians take action. Consider your own usage patterns on Facebook and other platforms. What kinds of things do you post? How often? Is any of it inflammatory? Do you try to convince people? Have you joined Groups dedicated to political issues? Do you get into fights over ideas on social media? Are there people whose posts consistently provoke you? Have you ever blocked people with whom you disagree? Do not feel bad if the answer to any of these questions is yes. The evidence is that most users of Facebook have done these things at one time or another because the algorithms are designed to promote that kind of activity. Now that we know what is going on, what are we going to do about it? Changing behavior starts with reconsidering your relationship to the internet platforms. That is what I did, especially for Facebook and Google. I still use Facebook and Twitter, but I have changed my behavior, especially on Facebook. I no longer allow Facebook to press my emotional buttons. I wish it were not necessary, but I no longer post anything political or react to any political posts. It took six months, but my feed is now dominated by the music side of my life, birthdays, and puppies. It might work for you, too. In addition, I erased most of my Facebook history. Facebook seems to have a built-in bias in favor of disinformation and fake news, so I am really careful about the sources of information on Facebook and elsewhere on the web. To protect my privacy, I do not use Facebook Connect to log in to other sites or press Like buttons I find around the web. I don\u2019t use Instagram or WhatsApp because of my concern about what Facebook is doing to those platforms. I avoid using Google wherever possible because of its data-collection policies. Avoiding Google is inconvenient, so I have turned it into a game. I use DuckDuckGo as my search engine because it does not collect search data. I use Signal for texting. I don\u2019t use Gmail or Google Maps. I use a tracking blocker called Ghostery so that Google, Facebook, and others cannot follow me around the web. I am far from invisible on the web, but my shadow is smaller. I also have made changes relative to my devices. I use Apple products because that company respects the privacy of my data, while Android does not. I still check my phone way too often, but I have turned off notifications for practically everything. I only allow notifications for texts, and even then only vibrations. I read books on my iPad, so I keep it in Night Shift mode, which takes all the blues out of the display, reducing eye strain and making it much easier to fall asleep at night. I often put my iPhone in monochrome mode to reduce the visual intensity of the device and, therefore, the dopamine hit. I do not recharge my devices in the bedroom. I bought an Amazon Alexa smart speaker on the first day. About an hour after I installed the device in the kitchen, an ad for Alexa came on the TV, and my Alexa responded. I realized immediately that Alexa would always be listening and that no one should trust it to respect privacy. My brand new Alexa went into a storage container, never to return. Unfortunately, the entire world of connected televisions, appliances, and other devices \u2014 the Internet of Things \u2014 shares Alexa\u2019s snoopiness. Unscrupulous vendors can use IoT devices for surveillance. Incompetent vendors may leave customers vulnerable to hacking by bad actors. All vendors will collect masses of data; no one knows what they will do with it. My advice is to avoid IoT devices, or at least avoid putting them on your network, until vendors commit to strong protection. Data privacy is sufficiently abstract that few people take steps to protect it. I recommend using a password manager such as 1Password to ensure secure access to websites. Despite the many hacks of data from servers and the harvesting of friends data from Facebook, few of us have experienced much harm, at least not that we can perceive. Too few among us realize that our data is being used to build artificial intelligence systems that predict our behavior. When you combine that predictive AI with manipulative technology of internet platforms, bad things will happen. What starts out as creepy can easily become unhealthy, if not dangerous. Until the internet platforms and IoT hardware companies demonstrate a commitment to safeguarding users, it makes no sense to trust them with your data or anything else. If you are a parent of a child eighteen or younger, think about whether you are a good digital role model. How often do you check your devices in the presence of your kids? How much do you know about your children\u2019s online activity? What is the ratio of online activity to outdoor play in your family? How often do you go online together with your kids? To what degree does your children\u2019s school employ computers and tablets? At what age did that start? How often do your children\u2019s classes engage in traditional group learning, where the students are encouraged to participate with classmates, as opposed to one-on-one activity? The medical profession has a message for parents: smartphones, tablets, and the apps that run on them are not good for children. When it comes to protecting children, there is mounting evidence that the only thing kids should do on smartphones is make calls. Just about everything else kids do on smartphones poses a threat of one kind or another. We used to think that kids were safer playing with technology than playing outdoors. We were wrong. At the margin, research suggests that less exposure to devices and apps is better at all ages but essential for younger children. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that parents not allow any screen exposure for children under two. There is a growing body of research indicating that parents should limit the screen time of kids under twelve to much less than current averages. The rationale for early exposure \u2014 preparing kids for life in a digital world \u2014 has been negated by evidence that screen time impedes childhood development to a far greater degree. Given how deeply smartphones, tablets, and PCs have penetrated everyday life, cutting screen time is much easier said than done. For example, many schools insist on using PCs or tablets in the classroom, despite evidence that computers and tablets may be counterproductive in that setting, both because of the negative effects of dopamine stimulation and a reduction in social interaction. It may not take much screen time to trigger an excess of dopamine in kids. Doctors have observed that kids with too much screen time suffer from a variety of developmental issues, including an inability to pay attention and depression. With preteens and teens, overproduction of dopamine remains an issue, but the exploitation of social media by bullies is also a problem. Even kids in their teens are unprepared to cope with the addictive powers of internet platforms on mobile devices. Parents face a daunting challenge. Even if they control technology at home, how do they protect their children elsewhere? There are devices everywhere, and too many people willing to share them, unaware of the danger. One possible first step is to organize small groups of parents in a format equivalent to a book club. The goal would be to share ideas, organize device-free play dates, and provide mutual support towards a goal that requires collective action. Small groups can be an effective first step in a long campaign to change the cultural zeitgeist. Adults are less vulnerable to technology than kids, but not enough so to be safe. Smartphones and internet platforms are designed to grab your attention and hold it. Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms are filled with conspiracy theories, disinformation, and fake news disguised as fact. Facebook and YouTube profit from outrage, and their algorithms are good at promoting it. Even if the outrage triggers do not work on you, they work on tens of millions of people whose actions affect you. Elections are an example. Facebook in particular has profited from giving each user his or her own reality, which contributes to political polarization. Facebook has managed to connect 2.2 billion people and drive them apart at the same time. One way we can defend ourselves is to change the way we use technology. There is evidence that internet platforms produce happiness for the first ten minutes or so of use, but beyond that, continued use leads to progressively greater dissatisfaction. The persuasive technologies embedded in the platforms keep users engaged. We cannot help but scroll down just a bit farther, in the hope of something really wonderful. We did not understand the dark side of internet platforms before we got hooked, but we can modify our behavior now. We can track our usage with apps like Moment and create device- free time periods or locations in our day. We can decide not to embrace new technologies that do not respect us. We can even delete some applications. I would like to think that the people who make smartphones and internet platforms will devote themselves to eliminating the harmful aspects. They have taken steps, but they have a lot of hard work to do. Policy makers in Washington and the states can create incentives for the internet giants to do right by their users. Executives in Silicon Valley should reassess their business plans in light of what we now know. Unfortunately, Silicon Valley is like a club. It is hard for anyone, even the CEOs of major tech companies, to speak out against companies as powerful as the internet platforms. The platforms act as though users will be too preoccupied to look out for their own self-interest, to insist on dramatic change. Let\u2019s prove them wrong. Parents, users, and concerned citizens can make their voices heard. We live at a time when citizens are coming together to bring about change. The effective collective action by Black Lives Matter, the March for Our Lives, the Women\u2019s March, and Indivisible should inspire us. All of them use Facebook to organize events, which would be poetic justice in this case. Bringing people together in the real world is the perfect remedy for addiction to internet platforms. If we can do that, the world will be a better place. Roger McNamee has been a Silicon Valley investor for 35 years.

How to block Big Tech with Kashmir Hill \u01c0 View", "content": "How soon after waking up do you check your phone? Do you compulsively refresh your Twitter feed? Can you find your way around without Google Maps? There are many obvious and tactile ways in which Silicon Valley has its hooks in our everyday lives. And as we see Big Tech face increased scrutiny, people are becoming more conscious of their interactions with their products: limiting screen time, quitting Facebook, shopping locally. But fully divorcing yourself from these companies is a lot harder than you may think, as journalist Kashmir Hill discovered. Because besides our obvious interactions with Big Tech, there are many more invisible ways these products and innovations touch our lives. This is Kashmir\u2019s story of what happens when you shine a light on those unseen encounters. KASHMIR HILL: I turn off my phone at night, like at 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. I just turn it off, which I used to never do. My phone would be on until the battery died. And that would be a very traumatic event. So now I turn off my phone at night. It's not the first thing I reach for in the morning. Whereas before I touch my husband, before I talked to my daughter, I would I just pick the phone up as soon as I woke up and start scrolling through it. I realized I actually hate that. I don't want to start my day every day mainlining the internet through this technology that has been forced upon me by the tech giants in the world that they're creating. CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to \"Why Is This Happening?\" with me your host, Chris Hayes. Like everyone in the modern world, I spend too much time on my phone. And I have a lot of self-loathing over that. I'm trying to decrease my phone time, decrease my screen time. But of course, part of the problem with that is that the phone is engineered to make you look at it as much as possible. It's like a casino. There's lots of thought that's gone into how to make it so that even that little click, when you reload Twitter or these little haptic bits of feedback are reaching into your brainstem to tell you, oh, that's a pellet of satisfaction. And they've engineered the device to make you want to look at it as much as possible. It's the same with the incredibly seamless way that streaming services have figured out to get the little box in there and just seamlessly go to that next episode so that you have to actually go and affirmatively say \"No, I don't want to watch another episode.\" They did that because they had lots of data. They were able to run the human experiments on us, the subjects, to see what are the ways that we can optimize the engineering of what we have to make people use our product as much as possible. So much about the tech world feels like that, I mean, that's what Facebook is doing. That's what Amazon is doing. That's what Apple is doing with the iPhone. At a certain point, you feel like you don't have any actual independent agency or autonomy with respect to the various digital services or digital devices you use. They're just kind of there and they're just pulling at you and they're getting their hooks into you and you're using them all the time. And there's this question of like, how can you just step away? Can you just stop? I see a lot of people really recently, I think, particularly around phone use. A lot of people deleting Facebook. There's a kind of rising sensation among the zeitgeist, I think, that we should taking individual and collective affirmative steps to kind of step back and fight against all of that engineering that has gone into making us addicted and hooked to and constantly drawn into the world of the kind of digital vortex. So then the question becomes like, well how can you do it? Can you just get away from these? What if you just don't want to use this stuff anymore? And that brings me to today's guest, Kashmir Hill, she's an investigative reporter at Gizmodo. She's a really, really great tech reporter. I've been following her work for years. I think, as you'll hear in our conversations, she really distinguished her reporting early on for being, I think, far more skeptical of the claims of Silicon Valley than many of the other people reporting on those same companies. Particularly during the frothiest years of rah-rah, cheerleaderism for the way that Silicon Valley was gonna transform the world and be the future of American society. We're now in a much different place I think, in the way that we think about those companies and about the effects of their products, but she was ahead of the curve on that. And she undertook this deceptively simple project at Gizmodo. And the deceptively simple project was like, \"I'm just gonna give up this stuff. I'm just gonna not use it. What happens?\" That's it, that's the full thing. And she spun out this incredible reporting project based on that just deceptively simple premise, which as you'll hear is astoundingly harder than that simple articulation of it is. I'm not going to use this stuff. Let's see what happens to my life when I step back from some of the biggest tech companies in our lives. Like our conversation with Stacy Mitchell about Amazon, you're gonna learn a lot about just how ubiquitous big tech is in our lives. You've been a tech reporter for awhile, right? KASHMIR HILL: It has been a decade, I think. Maybe a little bit more than a decade. I wasn't a tech reporter when I started. So I don't know when I morphed into a tech reporter but somewhere along the way people started putting me on tech lists. CHRIS HAYES: And then you've been reporting about Silicon Valley and tech for awhile. It seems to me that tech reporting has changed a ton, particularly recently and as someone who's been a practitioner for a little while, what do you think has changed? KASHMIR HILL: I think other tech reporters are more like me now. I really did not come from a tech-reporting background. I was at a legal blog called \"Above The Law.\" My background was in law and I got interested in privacy and I was writing about privacy and law and I kinda just backed into technology because I was writing about how our privacy was changing in the modern world and it forced me to start writing about cookies and tracking and all these new technologies that were being developed to track us. I would say I came into writing about technology from a more critical perspective in terms of how it was invading privacy as opposed to being a person that was kind of covering the business of tech or covering amazing new gadgets. I think people who came from that perspective, tended to be more enthrall of the tech industry. And amazed by all the incredible new things that it was doing and bringing into the world and making possible. And now, I think there's been a shift and those reporters and those publications are far more critical of the tech giants now. And there's more of a backlash in tech reporting. So I would say that overall it's become more negative but I'm proud to say I was always pretty negative. CHRIS HAYES: You've been a hater from day one is what you're trying to say. KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, exactly. CHRIS HAYES: Well, I think that's the reason that your work first stood out to me was for that reason when I started reading you on privacy, when you were writing about privacy back in \"Above The Law.\" And your work has been critical and clear-eyed in a way that a lot of tech reporting was not but more is now. To what do you attribute the change? KASHMIR HILL: One, I think that these companies and it's part of what my series touches on, have just become so much more powerful. And they're not little start-ups anymore. Google used to do amazing searches. Amazon made it easier to buy things online. Facebook helped us figure out who else in our class was hot and ask them out. And now, these companies do so much more. Amazon is powering the backbone of the web. Google is all over the internet. You can't go around online without running into something Google, they control all mapping technology essentially that's used online. And Facebook bought Instagram and bought WhatsApp and controls most of the social media that we consume. It's where all of our friends are living online. So, one, they've just gotten to be bigger players that I think attract more criticism. And they're starting to have real effects on how we live and some of those things are very negative. I mean, honestly, sometimes I think they get outsized attention or blame for things that are happening in society. But they do play huge roles in our everyday life now and I think that yes, it's engendered some criticism. CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, so the ubiquity, the size of the scope and the power and then also to me, I think, finding out what's underneath the hood is a big part of it. That you have the sense that I'm interacting with this thing and I'm writing the email and my understanding of my interaction with Gmail is like, they make a free software product, I use it, okay. I kick them five bucks a year, whatever, for some storage. That's not where the relationship ends. They're learning lots of things about me, everything about me. They're reading all of my words and they're using that to make money by essentially selling it. And I think to me, speaking for myself, the reality of that as a business model was much less clear to me, say three or four years ago than it is now. KASHMIR HILL: Right, maybe people understand the price we're actually paying online now. What's more disturbing is that I think other players looked at these tech giants and said, \"Wow, they're making so much money just off of people's data. We should start doing that too.\" CHRIS HAYES: Right. KASHMIR HILL: So you see things that we pay for, like our phone carriers. They're collecting data about our location and what we're looking at on our phones and they started packaging that up and they anonymize it and aggregate it and then they sell that. So even something you're paying $100 a year for, they're still packaging up your data and selling it. So that's been another kind of harmful effect of the spread of the tech giants business model. CHRIS HAYES: And this gets to what your project is, right? So describe to me what your undertaking is and how you came up with the idea? KASHMIR HILL: So when you're critical of these companies, when you say they're too powerful or they're too privacy invasive, people often will say, \"Oh well, if you don't like Facebook, don't use its products. If you don't like Google, just get off Gmail.\" And so I wanted to explore that argument and find out if it's possible not to use the company if you don't like it. And so that was kind of what I was trying to tackle here. And I found out that it's not possible to avoid them with the exception of Apple. Even if you choose to boycott their products, you're still interacting with them really all the time that you're online and with Microsoft and the rest really but in the real world as well. So you can't totally avoid them. The idea actually came to me because there's many people that are especially critical of Google. Google has a lot of enemies. And so somebody pitched me on the idea, they're like, \"Google's so powerful, you should try to avoid them and write about how hard it is.\" And I was like, \"Oh, that's actually a good idea but I want to do it with all the technology companies.\" CHRIS HAYES: Turns out Amazon pitched you on that story. They're like, \"You know who's really bad? You know who's really, really bad?\" So you set out with the project, I mean, I want to just reiterate a thing you just said. You can't choose not to use some of these companies. That's what you're saying, that's what you've concluded. KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, some of these companies are just unavoidable. You have to use them because or you will encounter them because they're all around the website and you're gonna use services that are using their services. CHRIS HAYES: To live in the modern world is to use Amazon for instance? KASHMIR HILL: Yes. CHRIS HAYES: And Google. KASHMIR HILL: Mm, yes. CHRIS HAYES: So tell me what you did, so you've got Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, right? KASHMIR HILL: Yes. CHRIS HAYES: Those are the big five. Okay. KASHMIR HILL: A lot of people are mad at me 'cause every time I would tweet one of these stories, they're like, well, what about Twitter? But I was trying to stick to kind of like, the really big five, the companies that people sometimes call the frightful five. CHRIS HAYES: Well, don't you also think that Twitter, in some ways, doing the experiment with Twitter I think would prove out the point which is that you can cut Twitter out of your life. KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, you'll probably run into the tweet button around the web but, I think it would be pretty easy. CHRIS HAYES: I mean, you'll run into people- KASHMIR HILL: Maybe healthy to cut out of my life. CHRIS HAYES: Yes, oh my god, would it be healthy. You run into people reading the president's tweets on the television. But from the tech standpoint. I mean, so you say, I'm gonna go through this sequence cutting these out, you start with Amazon, so my first thought was like, okay, not ordering anything from Amazon. Okay, yeah, sort of inconvenient but that's the tip of the iceberg, right? How did you go about doing this to make sure you were 100 percent cut off from Amazon? KASHMIR HILL: Right. I didn't want to just boycott their products. In part, because journalists have done that before. They've stopped using Facebook. They stopped using Google and they write about how hard it is. But I wanted to really cut myself off from them. In part, to make it a more interesting stunt but also to really understand how often I was encountering them in invisible ways, which I knew was happening because I write about the technology industry. So I worked with a technologist named Dhruv Mehrotra, and I wasn't sure exactly how to do this. I went to him and I said, \"Hey, I want to cut the tech giants out of my life completely, I don't want to interact with them at all. How do I do it?\" And he went and did some research and came back to me and said, \"Oh hey, all the technology giants publish these list of all the IP addresses, the internet protocol addresses that they control. So I could build something for you that would just prevent your devices from being able to interact with those IP addresses. To send anything to them or receive anything from them. And that way I would just cut you off entirely from these companies servers.\" So it means that Google's analytics on a page just wouldn't be able to load. Facebook's like button wouldn't appear there and any website that was hosted by one of these companies, which turned out most of the time to be AWS or Amazon Web Services. It just wouldn't load. CHRIS HAYES: So this is the first thing I found shocking and hadn't even thought of is, the sheer amount of just web traffic and IP addresses controlled by these companies. It's enormous. KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, it's really big. I mean, what was fun about the stories \u2026 I love any story that dives into how the internet works. I think most of us just kind of think about it, is this like invisible vapor around us that you click on an app or type in a URL and then just information is there. So I always think it's fun to dive into all the ... I mean the internet's a strange place with all these standards bodies. So anyways, Dhruv did this research for me and said, Amazon and Microsoft control over 20 million IP addresses. Google had about nine million, which I was kind of surprised by, that it was a bit of a laggard there. Facebook had only about 122,000 or something, a very small amount of IP addresses. And Apple had a bunch, I think they were around 16 million. And this is just like the number of IP addresses that they own, they're kind of squatting on them. And sometimes IP addresses, attach to a device on the internet. But it just gives them a way to roll out services and have a place for your internet traffic to go to get them. CHRIS HAYES: Yeah so, I guess, I'm sort of debating in my head how in the weeds of this to get because I will confess that I have no idea how the internet works. I mean, I really don't understand. It is basically magic and there's stuff floating around the air. There's how many bars I have on phone and then it's like [beeping noises] beams in. I know there are servers, I know there are networks. I know an IP address is a unique locator and that traffic goes in packets and hops from these sort of noted clusters from place to place and moves over these wires. But that's it. So when you say in the first one, you start to block all the Amazon IP addresses, my question is what are they? What does that mean? What can't you see? KASHMIR HILL: So I think the easiest way to think about it is those IP addresses, think of them as directions. IP addresses are directions to Amazon's server. CHRIS HAYES: Mm-hmm. KASHMIR HILL: And so every time my devices wanted to direct themselves towards Amazon's servers, Dhruv's blocker said, \"Nope, you can't go this way.\" CHRIS HAYES: And that happened a lot. KASHMIR HILL: It happened a lot, we did run into one little problem, and this is again how the internet works, Amazon AWS servers are huge servers that have all this data. And then sometimes a company wants its website to load faster. So they'll have a secondary service, called a content delivery network or CDN, and these are companies that have a whole bunch of little servers that are more prolific and so when you load a website, sometimes it'll get the information from that CDN, the little machines, who are storing it from the big machines from Amazon and it just means that you don't have to wait for the data packets to come all the way from the Amazon warehouse. You can get it from this smaller warehouse that's closer to your device. And so if we saw that CDN, we wouldn't realize it was coming from Amazon. So sometimes it messed up our blocker. CHRIS HAYES: Right. So just to go back, so you set up a ... Your tech dude sets up a VPN, it says for week one, no Amazon IP addresses. One of the first things you learn is actually even that doesn't fully screen on Amazon because there's these sort of small retail outfits whose backends are actually Amazon but don't look like Amazon to the VPNs so they're getting through. So you gotta try to figure that out. What else are you starting to deal with in week one of no Amazon? KASHMIR HILL: So just websites not working. And I'm a journalist and I was trying to do work this week and so I tried to go ... Every government website stopped working for me because they all use AWS. CHRIS HAYES: Every government website? KASHMIR HILL: Every government website that I tried to use. I didn't try all the government websites but I was doing some research that took me to a few of them. Journalism websites went down, I'm using this car rental service right now, called Drive Canvas and its website stopped working so I couldn't go see my bills. Some of my apps stopped working. I went for a run and I couldn't record the run on Runkeeper because it used AWS in some way. CHRIS HAYES: Wow. KASHMIR HILL: But the bigger problem was that it cut off of all digital entertainment for me. Because all video streaming sites use AWS, even Netflix, which is a big Amazon competitor. CHRIS HAYES: Wait, whoa. You mentioned that in the piece but I thought I was misunderstanding, because I thought you were just ... It's so funny, I thought you were just like a real Amazon Prime home for some reason and just super loyal to Amazon Prime so you cut off Amazon Prime and was like, \"Well, we can't watch anything.\" But what you're saying is, literally everything streams through the AWS backend, no matter what you're streaming it over. KASHMIR HILL: Pretty much. I mean, in my experience, HBO Go was down. Netflix was down, Hulu was down. AWS- CHRIS HAYES: That's crazy! KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, it's crazy and I think we could have listened to Spotify because Spotify is hosted by Google, except we listened to Spotify through our Amazon Echo, which I had to put away in a drawer. So yeah, we just had a very silent house. It's insane. Amazon recognized about a decade ago that web hosting was an important business, I think they're finding it with their own business, they developed this solution and then they released it to the world. And AWS is now the most profitable part of Amazon, not it's retail. Tons of people use them. They just have, I guess, a great service. Even their competitors are relying on them to host their movies and their data. CHRIS HAYES: I mean, the implications here are kinda crazy because Amazon's Prime Video is this big play they're making to compete with Netflix. You can imagine a world in which they're like, \"Oh look at that, would you look at that, we had a little glitch and then Netflix streaming went out.\" I mean, they're clearly not doing that now. I think if they were, we would know about it. It's a little weird that that is possibility. KASHMIR HILL: I know. What's hilarious is actually whenever we watch Amazon Prime Video, the streaming quality is terrible. I'm like, take lessons from Netflix. CHRIS HAYES: It is ironic, actually. So you cut your entertainment. You cut a million websites. My big takeaway from the Amazon week for you was, you cut ordering stuff from them which was a little bit of a pain. There's a great story about how you order something on Ebay and it comes in an Amazon package? KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, yeah. CHRIS HAYES: Why? KASHMIR HILL: Well, Amazon is so dominant in the kind of storage and shipping industry, that they have something called Fulfillment by Amazon. A lot of people that use competitors still use Amazon for storage and shipping. CHRIS HAYES: I mean- KASHMIR HILL: So I ordered from Ebay but it came from Amazon in an Amazon package. CHRIS HAYES: And there's a funny part, you eat some Whole Foods sushi, which you only realize after you put it in your mouth ... But it seemed to me that when you divide up that Amazon week, the ordering stuff and the Whole Foods and stuff is that you live withoutable, it's the architecture of the backend of the internet that is not. KASHMIR HILL: Right, which I kind of knew. I knew AWS was big. I didn't realize how big it was and I found that a lot of people reading the story didn't know about Amazon Web Services. Because it's invisible to you as your navigating the web. I've had a lot of people I talk to during the series, compare it to the environmental movement or the food movement. The slow food movement and being digital vegans, who are really careful about where their data comes from. But I think most people are just using the internet aren't thinking about where the data is coming from. I don't know, maybe that'll change but it was really interesting for me to be able see this because I type in a website and it just won't load. CHRIS HAYES: So what was the next hardest one to cut out? KASHMIR HILL: I think the next hardest was probably Google. I mean Google does do cloud hosting as well. Though they're not nearly as popular as AWS. But it was more that Google was really unlike all the sites that I went to and in a lot of apps. It's just that Google provides services that are used across the web. For example, I ran into on tons of sites something called Google Fonts and I could see that the website was trying desperately to load Google Fonts. And I\u2019m like, \"What the hell is Google Fonts? I've never heard of this before.\" It's a repository that they released around the time that they released Google Chrome that will automatically populate your browser with a whole bunch of font options. So that a website doesn't have to get the font from your computer and figure out a different font if your computer doesn't have it stored. So lots of sites use it. CHRIS HAYES: Turns out the entire internet is in comic sans without Google Fonts, like every page you load. KASHMIR HILL: Man, that would be great for getting people to use the internet less. CHRIS HAYES: So Google Fonts, which you as a tech reporter didn't know the product existed. KASHMIR HILL: I didn't. I didn't. Google says that they don't use it to track anybody, they have it in a kind of an FAQ somewhere. But still it means that, I mean, any site that has Google Fonts, you're interacting with Google's server and there's some information about you that's kind of being sent to them. Could be really basic and it doesn't sound like they use it. But I was just surprised to have it there on top of tons of other stuff, like Google Ads, Google Analytics. Just random Google trackers and then Google Maps are everywhere. CHRIS HAYES: That was the striking thing to me was that Google Maps really are the backbone of geolocation. Is that a fair statement? KASHMIR HILL: Yes. Absolutely, I tried to pull up stats on this and they didn't seem to exist in the same way that stats exist for other categories. But I basically looked at websites that look at the elements in various maps and apps. And it was something like, 80 percent or more of maps are powered by Google or by the Google Maps API, which is just quite a monopoly on the market. And the way that this manifested for me is that one morning I needed to get to a meeting and I was planning on Uber-ing there or Lyft-ing there but neither app would work for me and I'm like, \"What is going on?\" I just couldn't enter the destination. And it turned out that they were non-operational without being able to access Google Maps. I just couldn't even enter a destination. CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, you opt out of Google, you basically opt out of GPS functionally which is what I learned from your reporting, which I did not know. Again- KASHMIR HILL: I wouldn't say you opt out of GPS, my iPhone still knows where I- CHRIS HAYES: Your iPhone does, okay. KASHMIR HILL: Where I am. CHRIS HAYES: But individual apps or other things that are using the API, what is an API? KASHMIR HILL: It's like an automated way for computers to interact with database and pool information out of it. CHRIS HAYES: Right. KASHMIR HILL: I was really surprised because I don't know if your listeners would know but Yelp is a very big critic and enemy of Google. Because they've been so mad about the way that Google prioritizes its own listings above Yelp\u2019s. CHRIS HAYES: Yes. KASHMIR HILL: They've been in kind of like in an anti-trust battle for a long time but when I went to Yelp.com to find a restaurant to go to for lunch one day, it's map wouldn't load because it was using Google Maps. CHRIS HAYES: From the sort of internet infrastructural standpoint, Google and Amazon are near the top. I thought Microsoft was interesting in its inclusion because I think of Microsoft, I associate Microsoft with my childhood. I think of Microsoft in the same category as Sega Genesis. It really was of the moment at a certain point in my life. And then I stopped thinking about Microsoft as big tech player. I stopped thinking of Microsoft is being totally dominant, which in my youth they were. There was a big anti-trust case against them. Bill Gates was famously the richest man in the world. Yada, yada, yada. But Microsoft is still an enormous player. KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, we think, oh Microsoft's not cool anymore. But it's huge, I mean, it's constantly in competition for most valuable public company in the world. Of course, they make the X-Box, which is I think kinda cool. They make the workhorses of social media or they own them. GitHub, LinkedIn and Skype, which Skype I use quite a lot. They do that stuff that we traditionally associate with them, which is Windows Servers and Windows Office and Outlook. Those things are definitely still around and making the company a lot of money. I thought it would be really easy to get off Microsoft products and it was as a consumer but I just kind of started to notice when I was out and about, every time I went to a coffee shop, I was like, oh, this could very well be their point of sale system is probably run on a Microsoft server. And I was on BART, which is the subway in San Francisco and I was like, \"This is probably run on Microsoft.\" And I got into my car one day and I looked down, and it's a Ford Fusion 2015 and on the center console, which I never noticed before, was Sync, powered by Microsoft. So Microsoft was powering this entertainment navigation system in my car. Even though we don't think of ... They're not a super consumer-happy brand where we're thinking about, \"oh, we're using Microsoft all the time\" but they are still embedded in the infrastructure of our cities and in lots of governments, probably because their technology is kind of dated, are definitely still reliant on Microsoft. CHRIS HAYES: We work off of Microsoft workstations every day at the office. It would be a blissful release if I didn't have to do that. Really don't like my Windows machine. Sorry, tech, if you're listening, sorry. So Apple was the easiest, you say? KASHMIR HILL: So Apple was emotionally difficult for me because- CHRIS HAYES: Your phone. KASHMIR HILL: My phone, my laptop, my work laptop. I mean, Apple is kind of like my portal to all things digital. I became an Apple user maybe six years ago and once you become an Apple user, you're just kind of trapped in their ecosystem, all their ... I won't use a curse word here but their ports just the constantly changed ports. Oh, sorry, we're not gonna have a headphone jack anymore. I'm like, come on Apple, what is the matter with you. CHRIS HAYES: It is a dysfunctional relationship in my life where I got into this relationship with Apple. I liked their computers way more than I liked Windows. One of the reasons I got into it because iTunes and the early iPhone, which I had, you could sync music much more easily. And then as the years have gone by, it's become less and less usable. The products have gotten less and less usable. I mean, I do not have the IQ to work iTunes. I just don't get it. I don't understand it anymore. It makes me feel like a complete out of it old man because I don't understand the interface of iTunes. And I generally feel frustrated with Apple products a fair amount but there's no getting out. I can't get out. I got the ports and I've the account and everything's synced up in this one way and then I'm just stuck there. And they know that. And they know that so they don't work to make it any better. KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, we were Marie Kondo-ing our house and we just have 1,000 different Apple cords. I'm like, \"Do we even have a computer to go with this particular cord at this point?\" And it's also that Apple \u2014 I'm gonna generalize a little bit \u2014 but they make privacy and security easier. And so that keeps me there. And it's something I pay more for their products just for that kind of easy privacy security that's just kind of built in to it. It was just hard to get used to non-Apple products 'cause I hadn't used them in so long. But once I did get used to them, it wasn't that hard being away from Apple and I didn't encounter them anymore. If you don't use an Apple product, Apple doesn't track you, they're not trying to collect data about you. CHRIS HAYES: Kara Swisher and I did an interview with Tim Cook and it got a lot of news because he was pretty critical of Mark Zuckerberg who we'll talk about in a second and Facebook. But he made that point. Look, we made a decision that we sell you products, we engineer products, we sell you those products, we want you to purchase those products. That's how we make our money and we don't sell your data. That's not the business that we're in and we want you to have privacy and security and by in large relative to the other companies, that's true. But the other thing that I found insidious was your discovery in that week, which is because of that, even though it was emotionally hard to give up, they were the easiest one to avoid because they have made that decision. KASHMIR HILL: Right, Apple, because they've made that decision and Apple's basically not trying to sell products to non-Apple users. Which is part of the wall guard and it's part of what's kind of frustrating about them. Yeah, they're just not trying to reach across the divide. So yeah, they're not trying collect your data. I mean they did for awhile have iAds, which doesn't fit easily into Cook's narrative but they abandoned that, I think because it wasn't doing that well. Yes, it allowed them to just go the way of, we just sell you hardware- CHRIS HAYES: It's really interesting. KASHMIR HILL: The kind of privacy promises are, they seem reliable. CHRIS HAYES: Right, to me it's the ultimate illustration of the perverse incentives. Because if you make those ... I mean, I guess it's not because Apple's one the most profitable companies in the world. So it's not like they're suffering. But right, they've made a bet that we're gonna make superior products and people will pay for that. But the idea that they're ubiquity is less because they've made that choice, is a little unnerving because it makes me think that the incentives are for ubiquity and selling people's data and using their data and running things behind the scenes. And if those are the incentives, that's what we're gonna get more of. KASHMIR HILL: Well, I guess there's that lesson. I think the other lesson is, whether privacy becomes a luxury good. And Apple products are expensive products and part of what you're paying for is that this is a company that's not gonna be trying to monetize you or kind of track you in creepy ways. One of the kind of bigger takeaways from this project was if don't want to live in this surveillance economy, maybe we'll have to pay for things online. But that means that privacy will only be afforded to people who are wealthy. And people who can't afford it like, the poor, the most vulnerable people in society will continue to be exploited. So that's problematic to me. That's capitalism at work and that's where you think, oh maybe government needs to get involved and regulate this whole thing. CHRIS HAYES: That brings us to Facebook, which in some ways, I think, Facebook is most controversial right now. Has had the most negative press. I just think they handle all of it terribly. I can't tell, what do you think? Is it that what they're doing is indefensible or they've handled it terribly, I don't think I can figure it out. KASHMIR HILL: Which thing? I mean. CHRIS HAYES: Fundamentally the way that they are using your data and not regulating their platform, basically. KASHMIR HILL: So one thing I think is weird about Facebook is I just don't think that people who created Facebook ever dreamed of what Facebook would become. And I think all along the way, they have just been kind of haphazardly building this thing. Never realizing that one day they would have over a billion people using it and that they would become the data intermediary for a good portion of the world. And so, I always just feel like they're kind of just doing things haphazardly and not thinking about the consequences. And that the people who run it, just have no idea what the world is like for people who don't look like them. CHRIS HAYES: That seems like a totally accurate diagnosis but it also seems like the one they in a weird way are pushing. Because it's more exculpatory than the more nefarious one. Which is like, \"Oh shucks, oh darn. We just didn't understand this whole Rohingya thing and woo, I guess we aided a genocide. We've got a whole team now working on it.\" It's like, that's not good enough. KASHMIR HILL: No. CHRIS HAYES: That's my feeling. It's not good enough. You have the power and if you can't wield the power. The power has to be taken away from you. Because there is concrete evidence your platform is being used literally in the commission of genocide. Which is the worst thing that human beings do to each other and you're implicated in it. KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I don't think that they were able to foresee that in any way. I don't think they really know how to fix it. CHRIS HAYES: Yeah. What did you learn when you tried to block them? KASHMIR HILL: And yeah, I've long been critical of Facebook. CHRIS HAYES: I'm the one ranting about blood on their hands. So just to be- KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I just always think about, basically for the last two years or more, I've been obsessed with Facebook's \"People You May Know\" and how they figure out who we know in real life. Just because it's so creepy to people. And one of the things I figured out they are doing is every time you upload your contacts to Facebook, you're basically like outing anybody who's in there and Facebook takes that information and it layers it on other people's accounts. So maybe I've only given Facebook my phone number but if you give them my phone number and two email addresses for me, that all gets kind of layered into my account and by having this vast black book of the whole world they can figure out who knows who. And this resulted in sex workers having their identities outed to their clients. I discovered that was happening before I understood the contact thing and Facebook just wouldn't really engage with me and tell me how is it that sex workers and their clients are being connected through your platform. Sex workers use burner phones, burner email addresses. They have a fake name, their clients are doing the same thing and yet you're somehow still making these connections. And Facebook was kind of like, \"Oh, we don't really know how that would happen.\" They wouldn't be transparent about all that goes into \"People You May Know\" that would help people protect themselves against this. And that's what really bothers me so much about Facebook is that, one, I don't think they sympathize with the sex worker at all. And two, they don't want to be really candid with us about how their platform works. And so it makes it hard for us to protect ourselves against Facebook. CHRIS HAYES: No, that's exactly the thing that I find maddening about it. I'm not trying to single out Facebook as the most nefarious American company. I think the oil industry takes that crown. But I find them very gaslightly, I guess is what I would say over the last few years in the wake of this negative press, which is very much like, \"Oh yeah, no, don't worry, it's the secret sauce. No, we're not doing that, okay maybe. Well, yeah, there was actually a lot of that.\" Which feels like the revelation arc in everything and I just find it a little maddening. KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I get very frustrated by this company. I will say, so going off Facebook, they actually didn't track me that much once I wasn't using Facebook products. All this to say, all this bad stuff about Facebook, when it came down to it ... So we built this VPN that I was using to block myself off from the giants. At the same time we are blocking, we are tracking how often my devices were trying to interact with that giant and so the week I was blocking Facebook, it was much less. Google tried to interact with my devices over 100,000 times when it was blocked. And Amazon nearly 300,000 times. CHRIS HAYES: Wow. KASHMIR HILL: But with Facebook it was just 15,000 times, which is not that much. That might have just been me opening the Instagram account a few times by accident. So they do have trackers all over the web, they have Facebook Pixel, and the Facebook Like button. Pixel, I think is the one that causes a lot of anxiety for people because they'll be on their work computer and they'll be looking at some shoes and then later they'll be on their phones, scrolling through Instagram and they see an ad for those shoes and they're like, \"How does it know? Must be listening to my conversations.\" CHRIS HAYES: Yes, by the way, people are convinced that they're listening, are they? KASHMIR HILL: No. I mean, I don't think so. We just talked about how you asked Facebook what it's doing and it won't tell the truth so who knows. CHRIS HAYES: That is exactly the reality vortex I'm describing because I've had multiple people be like, \"Oh dude, they're listening to your phone, dude. What are you a child? How na\u00efve are you?\" I'm like, \"I don't think they are and if they are, that hasn't been established or reported.\" But what the hell do I know? KASHMIR HILL: I'm 88 percent certain that they're not listening or no one's listening. I did work with some researchers who tried to study this. They set up a whole bunch of phones with apps that were running all the time and they're just trying to measure whether the microphone ever got secretly activated by any of these phones or any of these apps. And they discovered other creepy things of course. But they didn't see any evidence that there's secret microphone activation happening. Though I'm always impressed or I'm always horrified 'cause people are so convinced that their phones are listening. And yet, they have it on their bedside table at night while they're having sex and take it into the bathroom. And I'm like, if you think your phone's spying on you, maybe you should put it away. CHRIS HAYES: I just got to rack up those likes on my tweet. I gotta see what I tweeted. I got to see if everyone's liking my tweet. I mean, that's part of it. I mean, so to me there's two aspects to this sort of grand takeaways. I mean, my big takeaway is, I don't know if I believe what I'm about to say but it's a possibility, Amazon is a utility that should be nationalized? Maybe Google is too, it should not be the case that a private company has that much power or is that intimately woven into the infrastructure of contemporary life? KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I mean, in the real world, the government built our roads and to a certain extent like powers our transportation system and our airports. And oversees the energy industry as extremely regulated. The digital world is huge now. We spend, it's sad but I think we spend almost as much time in the digital world as in the real world. Increasingly the borders between the two are gone. And the digital world, the internet has been built mostly by these private companies and they control the roads. They built the roads. They control the transportation systems. I think when you start looking at it that way and you realize the degree to which they built and controlled in infrastructure of our online environments and our digital environments, I find the argument that they're utilities and should regulated like utilities pretty powerful. CHRIS HAYES: But that was not my takeaway of, weirdly enough, of your reporting on Facebook and Apple, which are both incredibly present in one's life and in some ways, the thing we're talking about on the consumer end, is our addiction to them. And one of the revelatory things about your reporting is that there's the front facing consumer side and then there's the backend side, which you don't know anything about. And in many cases, it's way more ubiquitous and more difficult to get rid of and those are kind of different aspects of the problem. Is that fair to say? KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, in terms of where I landed with this experiment and what I've been thinking about is a lot of critics are asking the question right now, the degree to which these companies are monopolies. And I really felt that with some of the blocks. When I was blocking Facebook products, because Facebook owns Facebook and Instagram, they own the spaces where my community is, where all my friend are. And so I lost the ability during those weeks to communicate with my friends and share news with them and get news from them. One of my friends had a baby. And I didn't find out, she's one of my closest friends and I didn't find out until days later when I turned my Facebook account back on. I called her about it and she was like, \"Well, I just assumed if I put something on Facebook, everybody will see it.\" But there's this question whether they're monopolies and where the anti-trust scrutiny is in today's world and I think these companies combined have bought over 400 companies and start-ups in the last decade. Regulators in the U.S. haven't pushed back at all. It's been different in Europe. Europe has been more critical, they had this big fine against Google because of the way that it bought Android, the Android operating system, which 80% of the smartphone market uses. And then said, \"Hey, you need to bundle our apps up and put them on the phones by default.\" And Europe said, \"Hey, that's troubling from an anti-trust standpoint.\" So there's the regulation question. And on the other side, there's just the technologist solution. The question of why isn't there more interoperability between these platforms. When you get a phone number with a certain phone carrier, you're not locked into that phone carrier for the rest of your life. And you can call people who have numbers with different phone carriers. CHRIS HAYES: Thank god. KASHMIR HILL: It's amazing, right? CHRIS HAYES: What a miracle. KASHMIR HILL: What if AT&T and Verizon, if they just been able to lock us into their system. CHRIS HAYES: Right, sorry. KASHMIR HILL: You can only call other people who had Verizon. So technologists are kinda like, \"Why isn't there more technology platforms that are interoperable?\" I don't want to be on Facebook, I'm okay to be on Pinterest. Can I be invited to a Facebook event? Technologists are saying, \"Let's just go back to open source and make it decentralized and make everything interoperable.\" And then, the policy people are like, \"We need to regulate. We need to treat these companies as monopolies and we need to ensure that we're creating a marketplace with viable competition.\" And so, I kind of see that there's these two different paths with critics that maybe will just continue to be ignored but who knows. CHRIS HAYES: My takeaway was, in some ways they don't act anywhere near as terribly as they could. That's what I kept thinking. The idea that Amazon has in its power, it probably would be against the law, I think it would probably be a very clear tripwire for an anti-trust case, if they started messing with Netflix's streaming because they want to advantage Amazon video. But there seems to be less of that, than I would have anticipated. Partly it seems a little bit of a \"Clash of the Titans\" kind of thing. There's all these big companies, they're all more powerful than us. But they're also in fighting each other in ways that do restrain their behavior in certain ways that as I read through your piece, I kept thinking, \"Wow, Google could screw over Yelp by turning off their maps? If they really got into it.\" They're not acting as predatorily as they could, I guess is my point. KASHMIR HILL: Right, they could take more advantage of the power and data they have. I mean, we saw this happen very recently with Apple. I mean, Apple got mad- CHRIS HAYES: Yes, exactly. KASHMIR HILL: That Google and Facebook had used their kind of special all seeing powers. This corporate enterprise certificate. That you\u2019re only supposed to use with your employees with an app that you're distributing internally. They used this power for apps that they were using to spy on research participants, including teens. And so TechCrunch reported this and people got really upset. And Apple didn't like that they'd done this and so just overnight they pulled this enterprise certificate. Facebook and Google apparently was complete chaos because their internal apps didn't work anymore. So they didn't know what was for lunch in cafeteria and they couldn't book a spot on the Google and Facebook buses. And you saw how powerful it is. It was like, oh, that's a reminder, Apple controls the rails of how these things work and they can just say- CHRIS HAYES: Nope. KASHMIR HILL: That's not working anymore. When it happens in that way, it's really visible. I mean, I can't say with certainty that they haven't abused the powers that they have. The one thing I noticed in ... Lina Khan did this kind of blockbuster academic paper, blockbuster by academic standards about how Amazon's already a monopoly. And one of the things she mentioned in it, is that, AWS is probably collecting valuable metadata, and it could be ... Amazon is always entering new industries and it's gathering data that could be helpful to it in entering new industries. And one example of them, actually using that data was that they've invested in three start-ups, that they saw because they were hosting them on AWS that they were doing tons of traffic. CHRIS HAYES: Wow. KASHMIR HILL: So they basically saw that they were having gangbusters growth and they said, \"Oh, we should invest in these start-ups.\" CHRIS HAYES: Wow. KASHMIR HILL: So they have used the metadata from AWS in the past and that became reported, they could have just hidden that and said, we just decided to invest in these companies. I don't know how else they're using that data and I asked Amazon about it. And they just didn't respond. CHRIS HAYES: I should tell people that the series is up at Gizmodo, and you have articles and then you have videos that are on YouTube, of course, owned by- KASHMIR HILL: They're on our site, they're on YouTube, they're on Facebook. They're on all these platforms that I'm criticizing. CHRIS HAYES: Sit there and download some Amazon Prime Video of Kashmir Hill. There's an interesting human part of those videos, your child only likes three movies, which she can't watch during the week that you're not using Amazon because you can't stream video. Was there some kind of, for lack of a better word, spiritual lesson you learned about you as human being and your psyche and soul in relationship to technology? KASHMIR HILL: Yeah, I mean so by blocking the tech giants, as we've talked about, they kind of control the infrastructure of so much of the web and so many other devices. So by blocking the tech giants, I blocked technology writ large from my life in many ways. And it was wonderful. It was the digital equivalent of going on a juice cleanse. Where, I just reevaluated the role of technology in my life. I deleted stupid time wasting apps on my phone. I turn off my phone at night, like at 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., I just turn it off, which I used to never do. My phone would be on until the battery died. And that would be a very traumatic event. So now I turn off my phone at night. It's not the first thing I reach for in the morning. Whereas before I touch my husband, before I talked to my daughter, I would I just pick the phone up as soon as I woke up and start scrolling through it. I realized I actually hate that. I don't want to start my day every day mainlining the internet through this technology that has been forced upon me by the tech giants in the world that they're creating. I don't want to look at screens as much and I don't think we have to adopt all the technology that's being pushed at us by these tech giants and other companies. I think we really need to actively resist it because it's easy. I mean, it's so easy just to stare at screen and not be where you are, not be with the people that are around you. I guess that was my big realization. On the personal level, during the last day of my block, we were flying to New York. It's a five hour flight from California and we usually, we fly a lot with my daughter. And we usually just have an iPad and set her up in front of it. In the lead up to this, my husband was like, \"Okay, you have to end your block early. We need the iPad.\" CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, what's the policy there? She's not writing an article for Gizmodo. We gotta sit on a flight here. KASHMIR HILL: He's like, \"It's not you using the iPad, it's me using the iPad.\" And I was like, \"No, no, we have to do this, I want to stay strong.\" He's like, \"I'm moving, I'm gonna sit somewhere else on the plane.\" I held strong. We read books, we played with these little Wizzle sticks that sticky sticks for an hour that came with her Alaska Airlines meal. She slept for the last hour and a half, which she usually doesn't do when she has an iPad to stimulate her. And we landed and we get in the taxi and my husband turns to me and he says, \"That was the easiest flight we've ever had.\" CHRIS HAYES: Wow. I\u2019m a convert. I just threw my iPhone in the garbage here. It's done. I just tossed it. KASHMIR HILL: Just turn it off every once in awhile. Just turn it off. CHRIS HAYES: Why are you in my life! No. Kashmir Hill is an investigative reporter at Gizmodo. She just did this amazing series we were discussing about blocking the tech giants. It's such a smart conceit and it's so well conceived and I really thank you for making the time to talk. KASHMIR HILL: Thank you for popularizing it on your show, I appreciate it. CHRIS HAYES: Once again, great thanks to Kashmir Hill, investigative reporter at Gizmodo.

Its benefits are clear: the improved speed and latency the network enables the creation of smart cities, remote surgeries, and super-fast downloads, among countless other functionalities. But one question remained largely unaddressed \u2014 what are the health risks, if any, associated with 5G? A group of 170 scientists have flagged their concerns about the technology to the European Union calling on the bloc to review exposure limits, citing health risks for European citizens. Here's what you need to know: What are 5G frequencies? To account for the increase in the volume of information that will be transferred by 5G networks, more spectrum at higher frequencies will be required, a spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO) told Euronews. The highest frequencies used will be around ten times higher than those used by current network technologies \u2014 currently up to a few tens of GHz \u2014 which WHO said have already been used for many years in appliances like point-to-point microwave links. International guidelines exist up to 300 GHz, well beyond the maximum frequencies under discussion for 5G (a few tens of GHz). What are the current guidelines? While the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is currently revising its radiofrequency guidelines, it has presented a draft of advice relating to high frequency (from 100 kHz to 300 GHz) at a public consultation. \"The critical effect of high-frequency exposure relevant to human health and safety is heating of exposed tissue,\" it reads. \"High-frequency fields can penetrate into the body (the higher the frequency, the lower the penetration depth) ... this results in friction and thus heat.\" According to the ICNIRP, the body can accommodate a small increase in heat, in a similar way that excess body heat is dissipated when doing sport. But above a certain level, referred to as the \"threshold\", which depends on the duration of exposure, high frequency and the accompanying temperature rise can provoke serious health effects, such as heatstroke and burns. ICNIRP said the acute and long-term effects of high-frequency exposure below the thermal threshold have been studied extensively without showing any conclusive evidence of adverse health effects. Have the effects of 5G waves on our health been studied enough? The issue with the question of what risk 5G poses to human health is that \"nobody knows\", Dariusz Leszczynski, an expert in molecular biology and Adjunct Professor at the University of Helsinki, Finland, told Euronews. \u201cThe assurances of safety concerning 5G-emitted radiation are based solely on the assumption that low amounts of radiation are safe, not on biomedical research,\u201d he added. Specifically, the question mark lies over the effects of millimetre waves, also known as extremely high frequency, that 5G will tap into: \"We don't know what they will mean in practice for our immune systems.\" \"High-frequency waves only penetrate a few millimetres into the body and this is being used as a 'no worries' card by industries \u2014 but our skin is the biggest organ in the body and is linked to numerous things including immune response,\" Leszczynski explained. However, Prof Dr Alexander Lerchl from Jacobs University Bremen told Euronews: \u201cThere are many studies that have been conducted on the subject but they did not provide any evidence of health risks.\" He said calls for further studies were precautionary: \"As a scientist, one can never prove the non-existence of effects... however, this call has a more precautionary nature, because there is no concrete evidence of health damage.\" \"Exposure to radio waves is not new and health-related research has been conducted on this topic over several decades,\" said the WHO spokesman. Given 5G devices and networks are yet to be implemented, the increase in overall exposure to radio waves when it is added to an existing network or in a new area is unclear, it added. Should the overall exposure remain low relative to the international exposure guidelines provided by ICNIRP, \"there should be no consequences for public health\". WHO said it does not perform research nor fund research into the technology but will \"review the scientific evidence of 5G when the technology is deployed and relevant published health data are available\". Where does the risk come from? 5G antenna will be on every car and lamp post in smart cities and sensors will also need to be fitted in houses, as millimetre waves can't pass through walls and windows, Leszczynski explained, but this is not where most radiation is likely to come from. \"Like now, with 3G and 4G networks, most radiation will come from cell phones,\" he said, \"Cell towers will provide minuscule radiation compared to this\". \"Exposure from lamp posts will also be low unless you get close,\" he added. Who is responsible? The European Council set out basic restrictions and reference levels for the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields in a recommendation , however, these are non-binding for EU Member States. The primary responsibility for protecting the public from potentially harmful effects of electromagnetic fields remains with the Member States, including the choice of measures to be adopted based on age and health status, the European Parliament said in 2018. It has, however, set specific rules intended to protect workers from risks arising from exposure to electromagnetic fields in a directive, which Member States were required to implement in 2016. The group of 170 scientists from all over the world in July last year appealed to European Union institutions for 5G technology to be blocked due to: \"Growing concerns about the increase in radiofrequency radiation and the related health risks for European citizens.\" They cited a study carried out by the US National Toxicology Program which they said showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of brain and heart cancer in animals exposed to electromagnetic fields, even at levels below the current guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Among other things they also called on the EU to define new \"maximum total exposure standards\" from the point of view of health safety for all wireless communications within the EU. The EU responded that independent updates from its Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER), which are based on guidance from ICNIRP, did not provide any scientific justification to revise current limits. \"It would not be timely to undertake such a study before the results the ICNIRP\u2019s review of its guidelines have become available,\" it added. What can I do to protect myself? Leszczynski said the best way for people to protect themselves from the unknown risks surrounding the 5G rollout was the same advice as for 3G and 4G \u2014 to limit exposure. \"Use your phone as much as you like, but don't use it when it's not necessary,\" he added. Concretely, cutting long talks short and if you need to chat for a while, using speakerphone are two steps the professor recommended. In addition to turning the data on your phone off when carrying it in your pocket or close to your body. Lerchl agreed with this: \u201cPrevention makes sense until the last doubts have been dispelled,\" he said. \"It is probably better to be cautious.\u201d At the Mobile World Congress in February, industry leaders touted 5G as the next mobile revolution, with experts saying the network could be rolled out as early as next year.

{"_id": "101402598109_10156656971378110", "content": "In October 2018 the European Union (EU) announced it was funding a new automated border control system to be piloted in Hungary, Greece and Latvia. Called iBorderCtrl , the project uses an artificial intelligence (AI) lie-detecting system fronted by a virtual border guard to quiz travellers seeking to cross borders. Travellers deemed to answer questions honestly by the system are provided with a code allowing them to cross, while those not so lucky are transferred to human border guards for further questioning. iBorderCtrl is only one of many projects seeking to automate EU borders with the objective of countering irregular migration. This new tendency within Europe raises a series of serious human rights concerns. iBorderCtrl\u2019s technology is founded on \u201caffect recognition science,\u201d a widely contested discipline. Affect recognition claims to expose truths about someone\u2019s personality and emotions through the analysis of their facial features. Proponents argue that emotions are \u201cfixed and universal, identical across individuals, and clearly visible in observable biological mechanisms regardless of cultural context\u201d. According to them, studying faces \u201cproduces an objective reading of authentic interior states\u201d. iBorderCtrl is built on this logic, that an AI facial recognition system animated through computer-generated border agents can read people\u2019s feelings. Yet, as has already been proved repeatedly , AI facial recognition systems are inherently biased, learning prejudices reflected in the data used to train them. Project claims of reducing \u201csubjective control and workload of human agents and to increase the objective control with automated means\u201d are certainly misleading. Moreover, researchers across the board have demonstrated that affect recognition does not stand up to scrutiny and is being applied in dangerously irresponsible ways . iBorderCtrl is a case in point. While the project stresses that a \u2018human border guard\u2019 is always involved in entry refusals and such cases will never be determined solely through assessments made by AI, in practice this is an impossible guarantee. As Evelien Brouwer, Senior Researcher at the Amsterdam Centre for Migration and Refugee Law (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) explains: \u201cconsidering the high number of travellers, the possible lack of sufficiently trained staff, and the political reality pressing for restrictive border policies, the risks that decisions will follow judgements made by the AI system is too high. Practically, it will be very difficult for the subject, the data protection supervisors and courts to test whether or not an entry refusal is based on automated decision making or not\u201d. Lack of transparency in the development of the technology is equally concerning on a practical level, evoking the \u2018black box\u2019 problem so often attributed to AI. Border agents will have to rely upon technology that they do not understand, and travellers are expected to trust an opaque system with little accountability. Critically, iBorderCtrl is indicative of a wider trend in the EU of enhancing border monitoring capabilities through technology. For decades the EU has invested in securitising and militarising its borders, working towards the construction of what some describe as \u2018 Fortress Europe \u2019. Although investments in traditional border security systems intensified in response to the growth in people seeking safety in Europe in 2015, an increasing interest in AI and big data has resulted in the proliferation of so called smart border automated security solutions. We are therefore seeing the emergence of techno-solutionism in border monitoring system around the EU, along with the advent of further human rights violations. Looking at the number of projects using automated technologies for border control purposes funded by Horizon 2020 , the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever, is a clear indication of this trend. Take ROBORDER , a project using technologies which seem a distant reality, as an example. Also in its pilot phase, ROBORDER is being tested in the island of Kos in Greece and at the Bulgarian-Serbian land border, amongst other places. The project offers so-called solutions to current border challenges through \u201cunmanned mobile robots including aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles, capable of functioning both as standalone and in swarms, which will incorporate multimodal sensors as part of an interoperable network.\u201d This means the EU\u2019s air land and sea borders would be patrolled by swarms of robots alerting authorities of activities at borders whilst collecting large volumes of data to provide immediate and predictive overviews of situations. The web of data harvested creates a predictive security system enabling border securities to concentrate resources in designated areas. These predictive capabilities intensify security and surveillance both in the present and the future, endlessly increasing the detection and tracking capabilities. Accordingly, a system such as ROBORDER runs the risk of exacerbating the human rights violations inflicted by Fortress Europe. Using unmanned autonomous systems to securitise borders could also lead to robots being equipped, not only with sensors, but with lethal capabilities. In addition to the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots , which suggests the very real prospect of such eventualities, lethal robots have actually previously been proposed to the EU for border security systems. The Bulgarian state-owned company, Prono, wrote to Frontex about the development of a border security system with \u201cmanageable lethal influence on offenders without requiring constant monitoring by qualified personnel\u201d. Considering borders have already been largely militarised, automated weapons systems at borders may not be such a distant reality. Ultimately the deployment of new technologies such as those discussed ( and there are clearly many more ) to automate EU border security systems, raises multiple human rights concerns. While the past and present human rights implications of Fortress Europe have been widely catalogued, future ones, spurred on through technological shifts reshaping the EU\u2019s border security landscape, urgently need addressing. Considering how much human suffering and grief border policies have caused, and the EU\u2019s growing techno-solutionism approach to border security, it would be careless not to scrutinise new technological developments defining Europe\u2019s fortress of tomorrow.

Earlier that day, France's National Assembly approved the app by a vote of 338 to 215 amid concerns over the spread of COVID-19. App measures proximity The tracking app, called StopCovid, uses bluetooth to trace when a phone is in proximity to others who have the application. Once someone records a positive test for COVID-19, the application sends out an alert to those who have been in contact with that person for more than 15 minutes so they can self-isolate to prevent further spread of the virus. The phone app does not reveal the identity of the person who tests positive for coronavirus. Data protection advocates concerned This type of proximity phone app has come under fire by data protection advocates who say that governments could track location information or store users' personal data. France's digital economy minister C\u00e9dric O has said that the app will not be used to geolocate users but some members of parliament still raised concerns about its functions. French MP Charles de Courson compared the phone app to Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\", asking whether \"general surveillance\" was moving forward during the parliamentary debate. \"The illusions of a better world thanks to the digital evaporate and the citizens discover the progressive loss of their freedom,\" he said. The president of the parliament's laws committee, Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet, said her \"initial fear was a sort of 'Big Brother'. I did not want the app to be obligatory or to geolocate or conserve data.\" Braun-Pivot said that she was now satisfied with the app which people can install or delete and that is \"independent of Apple and Google.\" \"It should be up to users to decide whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages of using contact tracing apps,\" said Greg Nojeim, the Senior Counsel and Director of the Freedom, Security and Technology Project at the Centre for Democracy & Technology in Washington DC. \"Governments can encourage app use by dropping demands that location information be collected through the apps, and by ensuring that users control the data these apps will generate about their contacts.\" Other countries are considering the use of phone apps to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Secondly, anticipating the deeper drivers of conflict. We could combine new imaging techniques \u2013 whether satellites or drones \u2013 with automation. For instance, many parts of the world are experiencing severe groundwater withdrawal and water aquifer depletion. Water scarcity in turn drives conflicts and undermines stability in post-conflict environments, where violence around water access becomes more likely, along with large movements of people leaving newly arid areas. One of the best predictors of water depletion is land subsidence or sinking, which can be measured by satellite and drone imagery. By combining these imaging techniques with Machine Learning, the UN can work in partnership with governments and local communities to anticipate future water conflicts and begin working proactively to reduce their likelihood.

This mathematical approach can help us to generate models of our uncertain, dynamic world with limited data. With better data, we can eventually make better predictions to guide complex decisions. Future senior peace envoys charged with mediating a conflict would benefit from such advances to stress test elements of a peace agreement. Of course, human decision-making will remain crucial, but would be informed by more evidence-driven, robust analytical tools. Doing the above inside the UN, which is equally enthusiastic and cautious about change, is no easy task. It will require training staff and senior leaders in new approaches and trusting in their competence. And it will also require collaborating with university researchers, and forging close partnerships with leading private AI and technology firms. The good news is that the work has already started.

Together with MEP Tibor Szanyi (S&D), Bogovi\u010d (EPP) started the Smart Villages for Europe movement with the aim to reverse the current depopulation and brain drain from rural to urban areas across Europe.\u00a0With the support of the two largest groups in the European Parliament, the two secured a budget for their project in the EU\u2019s 2018 budget line. Bogovi\u010d (EPP) spoke to EURACTIV\u2019s Claire Stam in a telephone interview. \u201cWe already know that less and less money is being made with basic agriculture and we have to bring more added-value in rural areas,\u201d Bogovi\u010d said. The Aim of the Smart Villages movement is to revitalise rural communities and make them more attractive and sustainable by using the full potential of digital and telecommunication technologies, he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to bring jobs.\u201d Bogovi\u010d hosted the European Action for Smart Villages, which took place at lake Bled in Slovenia on Friday (13 April), together with Violeta Bulc, the European Commissioner for Transport. The conference was attended by Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan, Maria Gabriel, Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society and Regional Policy Commissioner Corina Cretu. MEP Tibor Szanyi and Pekka Pesonen, the Secretary-General of Copa Cogeca, were also present. \u201cEU rural areas offer great business opportunities and they can become even more attractive if we can attract investors and enable farmers and other local actors to use their potential\u00bb, Bogovi\u010d said, citing biomass, sustainable food production, tourism and culture as examples of new business opportunities that can be unlocked by the deployment of digital technologies in rural areas.  Overcoming the digital divide\n Overcoming the digital divide Bogovi\u010d recalled his experience as a mayor of a small rural town in Slovenia and as the minister of agriculture and environment in Slovenia. \u201cSome 84% of Slovenian farms are small or medium-sized farmers. Their number has been dropping rapidly, with a nearly 14% decrease in recent years, which accounted for a decrease in jobs by close to 20%,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we know that small and medium-sized enterprises generate more jobs on average than large multinational producers. That\u2019s the case in Slovenia but also elsewhere in Europe,\u201d Bogovi\u010d added. In this context, digitisation is key to revitalise rural areas and make them more attractive. This is why overcoming the so-called digital divide between urban and rural areas is crucial. \u201cWe speak about \u2018smart cities\u2019, but we don\u2019t speak enough about \u2018smart villages\u2019,\u201d Bogovi\u010d explained, adding that policymakers, farmer organisations and other stakeholders acknowledge the \u2018digital divide\u2019 between rural and urban areas. Of the 300 million EU citizens living in rural areas, only 25% are covered by fast or ultra-fast broadband, compared to around 70% coverage in urban areas.  What is a Smart Village?\n What is a Smart Village? Smart Villages is a relatively new concept within the realm of EU policymaking. It refers to rural areas and communities which build on their existing strengths and assets as well as on developing new opportunities thanks to digital technologies, the European Commission wrote in a note. \u201cDigital technologies and innovations may support quality of life, a\u00a0higher standard of living, public services for citizens, better use of resources, less impact on the environment, and new opportunities for rural value chains in terms of products and improved processes,\u201d the note read. \u201cThe concept of Smart Villages does not propose a one-size-fits-all solution. It is territorially sensitive, based on the needs and potentials of the respective territory and strategy-led, supported by new or existing territorial strategies,\u201d it added."}

It places the emphasis on the need for integrated approaches, and the interaction between di-fferent policy fields to increase complementarity, coherence and leverage the advantage of large-scale synergies. We believe \u2018smart villages\u2019 offer the best way forward for a sustainable realisation of the \u2018Cork vision\u2019. This concept is currently being carved out in the European Parliament. As a continent, Europe needs to create a political climate where we see opportunity and potential in innovation rather than focusing on dangers and threats. Europe has traditionally been an exemplary smart model, investing heavily in human resources and innovation and development, which has continually placed life quality before rapid economic gain and made up for missing natural resources with superior economic and living strategies. With this in mind, there is a clear need for the new integrated, innovative approach described as \u2018smart villages\u2019 in European rural areas. We have actively been pushing this concept forward via a pilot project in the 2016 EU budget titled \u2018special EU Action for smart villages\u2019, which received the full commitment of the European Commission in 2017. The approach has also been mentioned in official publications and was the subject of a preparatory action programme for this year\u2019s budget. These strategic, financial pillars of the project are continuously supported by a series of events such as the next high-level meeting in Bled, Slovenia on 13 April, in the presence of three European Commissioners and their Slovenian ministerial counterparts as well as the Slovenian Prime Minister. This demonstrates their political support for an initiative that could change the way we live in Europe. As politicians, we need to recognise the needs that are important for future development. There are many innovations here in Brussels that were the results of feedback from our constituencies. Brussels has the potential to kick-start a \u2018European Silicon Valley\u2019 and not only at legislative level. Rural areas face a real and complex challenge, which needs to be tackled by a smart approach. The \u2018smart cities\u2019 concept has already borne fruit throughout Europe. It is a logical consequence for us to now develop a \u2018smart village\u2019 to add to what is already working in cities. We have an in-depth strategy and the suitable technologies to revitalise rural areas, reverse the trend of depopulation and protect people against rural poverty. When we talk about European villages and rural areas, we do not solely mean the 22 million European farmers and people working directly in the agricultural sector. More than half of the EU\u2019s land area is within regions classified as predominantly rural; these areas are inhabited by more than 112 million people. In order to ensure that the CAP remains an EU success story, we need adjustments and a change of focus. Rural areas face specific challenges that need specific solutions. Ageing populations, lack of services (medical, postal, health, transport and energy) and limited broadband must all be addressed. Ensuring digital access can help sustain a healthy agriculture sector that in turn can help rural areas stem themselves against depopulation and help them retain young people. Our new \u2019smart village\u2019 approach is holistic and designed for implementation Europe-wide. The concept sets out to create liveable European villages where people can and want to be based, because innovative, digital solutions improve their lifestyle. New business models and platforms based on the shared economy, which are currently concentrated in urban areas, are great examples. The \u2018smart village\u2019 projects wants to extend the opportunities these models bring to rural areas and complete the digital single market. In other words, we want to provide digital opportunities for people and businesses. High-speed internet connectivity and adequate digital knowledge could attract new employment opportunities and create a business-friendly environment in European villages. Education in remote areas could be revitalised using digital platforms. Quality education in small villages could bring opportunities for children that they never have previously enjoyed, thereby allowing them to stay in their respective villages while the world could open up for them.

At the start of the year, a single Bitcoin was valued at $1000; by October its value had shot up to $5000, and is expected to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Bitcoin, along with other virtual currencies, is based on the digital innovation of blockchain technology, which is now capturing the interest of many MEPs. Eva Kaili, Chair of Parliament\u2019s science and technology panel (STOA), said, \u201cBlockchain is more than a technology; it is an infrastructure upon which we can build wider applications such as the Internet of Things, smart cities and infrastructures.\u201d Hosting a parliamentary event with the Global Blockchain Business Council in October, where technological innovators, start-up entrepreneurs and MEPs exchanged views, the Greek S&D group MEP highlighted the potential of this new digital technology. The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the Juncker investment plan are currently funding research into how this technology can be used. Blockchain is a transparent and decentralised way of indelibly recording a list of transactions. It is best known for creating new cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In spite of not being backed by a central bank, users trust cryptocurrencies because they o\u00adffer fast, cheap and secure public records. The technology can also be used in non-financial applications such as elections, or where it is important to know ownership histories, trading property/land, or managing supply chains such as ethically-mined diamonds. Other uses could include enabling of trade in digital media or even in the provision of public services such as health and welfare payments. Recognising the \u201cdisruptive potential\u201d of this technology, Kaili told attendees, \u201cWe need to identify how we will optimise what we already have and how to manage this new technology. This entails two practical aspects; interoperability and institutional certainty. \u201cInteroperability requires standardisation, and institutional certainty requires legality and security that reduces the exposure of people to fraudulent behaviour.\u201d For Kaili, standardisation is critical. Pointing out how the use of \u2018www\u2019 was the basis for the development and expansion of the internet, similar standards were also needed for blockchain. Another weakness the Greek deputy identified was \u201cscalability\u201d. At the moment, blockchains were limited to one megabyte in size, to reduce the threat of spam. Blocks larger than one megabyte were automatically rejected, with only three transactions allowed per second. Given the massive popularity of Bitcoin, this has created bottlenecks in the currency trade, resulting in increasing transaction fees. Kaili wanted to see the EU create a \u2018passport\u2019 for blockchain products, similar to the one created for the trade in financial products, so as to \u201cavoid regulatory fragmentation between EU member states.\u201d She also wanted the Commission to create regulatory \u2018sandboxes\u2019, similar to the ones the Bank of England created for British FinTech companies. There, new products were tested and traded for three to six months with real consumers under loosened regulations, rather than introducing new regulations German S&D group MEP Jakob von Weizs\u00e4cker, Parliament\u2019s rapporteur on virtual currencies, backed Kaili, saying, \u201cWe should not regulate too early, so as to avoid stifling innovation. \u201cNor should we delay regulation until some applications have become systemic. \u201cTherefore, the right approach is not wait and see but wait and monitor closely and then regulate promptly and forcefully if and when the need arises.\u201d As part of his report, Weizs\u00e4cker proposed a special task force, which is now being created by the European Commission. The German deputy also stressed \u201cthe EU\u2019s role should not be limited to supervision and regulation. We should also attempt to pioneer innovative blockchain applications on the part of government.\u201d His fellow EPP group member, Antanas Guoga went as far as calling blockchain technology a \u2018revolution\u2019. \u201cThe application of this technology can empower citizens to enjoy transparent, secure, smart and faster governance because of technology\u2019s properties like decentralisation, consensus without any central authorities and third parties. Blockchain is changing the core of the coding, storing data and financial systems.\u201d However, the Lithuanian MEP admits that, \u201cthe technology challenges some of the modern state\u2019s main functions, o\u00adffering new ways for person\u2019s identification and issuing of money.\u201d He wanted the Commission to address both these challenges and threats. \u201cI support the Commission\u2019s intention not to stop the development of these innovations by over-regulating it and focusing on enablement of the technology by supporting distributed ledger-based projects, setting up cooperation frameworks, piloting initiatives, and education.\u201d Guoga also called on member states to take advantage of and foster the technology more quickly in other sectors including as healthcare, transport and even agriculture, with the aim of decreasing food waste. \u201cCurrently, the biggest value I see in applying blockchain is in traditional banking services. It\u2019s a huge leap forward and a huge opportunity.\u201d ECR group MEP Ashley Fox admitted blockchain had a negative reputation because of the early use of Bitcoin in the dark web to purchase illegal goods. \u201cHowever, he stressed \u201cthe potential of blockchain, or more broadly distributed ledger technology (DLT), is great. We need to take a progressive approach to DLT. We cannot apply existing regulation and modify it to fit. \u201cGibraltar, which is part of my constituency, is doing exactly that with their DLT regulatory framework. They are opting for a principles based approach, which I think the EU would be wise to implement.\u201d The new technology is also backed by Swedish Green MEP Jakop Dalunde. \u201cBlockchain is an interesting new technology that enables decentralised management of important and sensitive information.\u201d He added that blockchain \u201cwill lower the thresholds for new solutions and business models in various fields such as the finance, real-estate and renewable energy. It is crucial that EU develops a forward looking set of rules that promotes new ideas and innovation.\u201d One of Europe\u2019s biggest competitors, Japan has already announced new rules to allow people to pay for goods and services by Bitcoin."}

At the same time, Nokia Networks has increased jobs from 2100 to 2500 in Oulu. In Oulu, Nokia has the biggest factory and a very large R&D centre today. Nowadays, we have many start-ups.

Yes, for us it is good. Ten, fifteen years ago, we were dependent on what Nokia liked to do. Nowadays, we have many kinds of firms in many sectors. It is much safer for the city.  Oulu is a city close to the borders of several other countries. Is the location important for its development?\n Oulu is a city close to the borders of several other countries. Is the location important for its development? We have strong relations and cooperative structures with other cities, especially in the Arctic region and in smart community development. We are located between Europe and the Arctic region. From this position and with our Arctic experience, we can help Europe cooperate with the north. The EU is now very interested in Arctic issues. For example, the EU would like to know what we can do to improve the flow of information, goods and labour.  Can you give an example of such cooperation? \n Can you give an example of such cooperation? In 2016, the EU gave Oulu the responsibility to coordinate with the Bulgarian city of Sofia and with Estonia a partnership on digital transition within the EU Urban Agenda. This is due to the fact that Oulu has 50 years of experience in wireless technology. If you use a mobile phone, you are using a smart solution developed in Oulu. That is very much linked to the common history of Nokia and Oulu. At the moment, we are developing 5G solutions using fast wireless networks. We also work with the cities in the Arctic area: Lule\u00e5, Sweden, and Troms\u00f8, Norway. We also work with a lot of cities in Estonia and Spain. But we also work with Japan and China, the destination for exports of our firms.  How do you use digitalisation in improving services for citizens?\n How do you use digitalisation in improving services for citizens? For five years, Oulu has invested in OuluHealth, which is a public-private ecosystem for the stakeholders in the health sector. These systems also allow us to provide new kinds of solutions and products to people in Oulu and globally. One example of global knowhow in wellness product and solutions developed in Oulu is the Polar Heart Rate Monitor Watch. Oulu has developed traffic signal pre-emption systems. It gives automatic green lights on intersections to emergency vehicles \u2013 ambulances, firemen and police. Another example: If you want to build a house, you need a license from the city. In Oulu, it can be done from your computer at home. It is much quicker and easier."}

Electricity will be entirely decarbonised by 2050 and the steep reductions in the price of wind, solar and batteries create the conditions for an electro-mobility revolution. That\u2019s not just electric cars but also trains, bikes, scooters, vans and, ultimately, hybrid and electric trucks that can be recharged through overhead lines. These vehicles will support the grid by providing a flexible source of storage and demand \u2013 charged mainly at night when demand is low. The dieselgate scandal has helped show the car industry the writing is on the wall for the infernal combustion engine. Nissan-Renault was an early mover in developing battery electric vehicles, but in recent months billions in investments have been committed to by Volkswagen Group and Mercedes, while both have teamed up with BMW and Ford to develop a fast charging network that will charge the car while you have a cup of tea. Other manufacturers have similar plans. This is no longer greenwash. Secondly,  cars will be connected\n cars will be connected . They will communicate with one another and road infrastructure so that traffic lights will turn green instead of red as we drive towards them. This could improve efficiency and help reduce urban congestion and emissions by 5%. But connectivity is a double edged sword; we will need to ensure that the road space created by the connected car efficiency is not lost through more vehicles driving on the road. Thirdly,  cars will become autonomous\n cars will become autonomous . Driverless vehicles integrate well with electric cars. 10-20% energy savings could be possible if driving efficiency is optimised. Also, with more than 90% of accidents caused by human error, automation will dramatically lower crash rates and thus allow safety equipment to be shed. The smaller and lighter vehicles could bring a 20% reduction in fuel consumption. And fourth, whether connected, driverless and electric cars really deliver more sustainable mobility will depend upon whether  cars are largely shared\n cars are largely shared or owned. If we don\u2019t share, the extra road space that connected vehicles can free up, as well as the lower time and running costs of electric and driverless cars, will simply pull more traffic onto the road. Traffic jams of single-occupant cars will be worsened by driverless cars. So we need shared vehicles to displace our inefficient, expensive private ones that anyway sit unused 95% of the time. So how do we make this happen? How do we ensure we create a sustainable transport heaven and not a driverless car hell? Driverless cars must be electric. We must ensure that the risks of expanding car use through automation are minimised by at least ensuring the vehicles are zero emission in use. Also, road pricing for cars must be used to suppress the insatiable demand for road space and ensure driverless, electric cars are integrated into public transport systems. Fuel duty revenues will anyway have to be replaced. Electric cars must pay less than dirty diesels. Shared vehicles must also pay much less than privately owned ones that should pay a premium for using the road. In highly congested city centres private cars may ultimately need to be banned; in the short term banning first dirty diesels and then all internal combustion engines from our cities is an important step. As connectivity creates road space \u2013 and sharing increases \u2013 road space must be reduced. We must turn our carparks into parks, our multi-stories into affordable homes. As our urban population grows we must create space for people to live in cities and reduce the dominance of the car but not eliminate its unique benefits. All this will require transport to attract the political attention it so desperately needs and so consistently fails to attract. It will require a level of integration of EU, national and city level transport policy that we are light years away from and require the European Commission and national Governments to share the responsibilities. Cities must be given the resources and powers to act. The change will require substantial investment and innovative financing but the benefits to our environment, our economy and our quality of life are huge."}

Kristian Ruby is\u00a0Secretary General at Eurelectric. Being three to four times more energy-efficient than conventional cars, but also enhancing air quality and noise levels in cities, electric vehicles will play a growing role in mobility, not only substantially reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy efficiency. Today, transport is responsible for about a quarter of EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and it is almost exclusively dependent on oil products for fuel. It is actually the only major sector in the EU in which GHG emissions are still rising. In order to achieve the planned emission cuts in transport (-60% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels), electrification of road transport plays a crucial role.  Decarbonisation of transport calls for EVs\n Decarbonisation of transport calls for EVs Battery electric vehicles reduce drastically the GHG emissions of road transport. They do not have any tailpipe emissions and all emissions linked to power generation are subject to the EU ETS and thus capped. Even when counting these emissions as transport emissions, with the current European power mix, electric passenger cars emit 50g CO2/km, already significantly less than the 2021 fleet emission limit for new cars of 95g CO2/km. In 2016, the average emissions of new cars sold were still 118g CO2/km. Although there might still be some room for improvements in internal combustion engines, these will not bring us close to the needed emission reductions. Moreover, other pollutant emissions, such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, a major cause of smog in our cities, can be drastically reduced by switching to electric cars. This issue is becoming increasingly urgent. According to the 2016 EEA Report on air quality, nine out of 10 EV citizens living in cities are exposed to air pollution at levels above the WHO guideline value. Poor air quality needs to be addressed. It causes serious problems to human health and it is the number one environmental cause of premature death in the EU. In 2013, health-related costs of poor air quality in Europe were in the range of \u20ac330\u2013940 billion, according to the European Commission.  EVs are already a reality\n EVs are already a reality This year, several countries took the initiative. France announced this summer that it plans to ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 and the British government followed soon after with a similar announcement. And China, the world\u2019s largest car market has just announced ambitious sales targets as of 2019. This triggered an avalanche of announcements from car companies about their intention to produce more EVs. Numbers are expected to grow rapidly as Volkswagen Group announced 80 new electric models by 2025, BMW announced 12 different EV models by 2025 and Honda announced that 15% of its annual sales will be battery electric by 2030. But the question is whether it will be enough to keep up with international competition. Considering that EVs are getting ready for mass deployment, the industry and policymakers must ensure that these technologies live up to their potential and help transform the energy system. While there have already been some positive signals from policymakers, a clear framework is needed.  Zero emission mandates needed\n Zero emission mandates needed From a consumer point of view, there is a lack of choice in the car market today. Consumers with a preference for clean, electrified transport are at a disadvantage both in terms of vehicle choice and access to charging infrastructure. From the policy side, ambitious CO2\u00a0emission performance standards for cars and vans are therefore necessary. That will lead to the accelerated uptake of zero-emission vehicles. And these standards will send a strong political message to manufacturers and consumers while ensuring long-term investment signals. Needless to say, these standards must be properly verified and test cycles should be backed up by real-world driving tests. In addition, mandatory quotas on vehicle manufacturers are needed to ensure that a proportion of car sales is made up of zero-emission vehicles. Such a provision is needed to provide customers with choice and to give a necessary boost to EVs early deployment, offering both manufacturers and infrastructure providers a clear signal on the direction Europe is taking. This will lead to important investment decisions, also in neighbouring sectors, like battery manufacturing. If we can be sure that electric vehicles deployment will speed up in the coming years, investments in charging infrastructure will equally speed up. There is a huge potential in deploying smart charging infrastructure. Automated management of the charging process will not only help to optimise grid usage but also facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable sources as EV charging can be scheduled for times of high feed-in of renewable generation. This will help to mitigate necessary grid investment and also reduce curtailment of renewables. Finally, it is critically important for policymakers to realise the need to avoid the risk of working in silos. Transport policy-making needs to increasingly work together with energy and environmental policymaking. Policy coordination needs to rapidly evolve in seamless policy integration to meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement goals. It\u2019s time for policymakers to act. It\u2019s time to give consumers choice and let them drive the change."}

That is according to an EU smart cities programme which is pioneering the delivery of smart lampposts in six cities across Europe, including London, Lisbon and Milan. European cities spend around \u20ac3bn on streetlighting each year, and this figure could be reduced to around \u20ac900 million through smart lampposts, Sharing Cities research claims. With three-quarters of current streetlights more than 25 years old, cost savings and reduced maintenance costs would also be made. Smart lampposts can collect data on parking capacity availability, a trait which Sharing Cities said would provide an \u201cingenious way\u201d to reduce air pollution levels and chronic congestion problems. Traffic jams are thought to cost EU member states \u20ac100bn a year.

Artificial intelligence is inescapable. We are in the midst of a new revolution, or at the very least a new stage in the industrial revolution. This presents great opportunities, both in terms of the economy - particularly job creation - and improving quality of life. As such, more and more data is collected, saved, processed and re-used, for better or for worse. Often, people are not aware of what information is collected, or how much of it is collected; data is being analysed more and more and without any human intervention. The huge amount of data that is stored has become a trading good in its own right - regardless of why the data was collected in the first place - and a source of considerable profit. Parliament's civil rights, justice and home affairs committee decided to tackle the issue, something the GUE/NGL group strongly supports, given the considerable risks to fundamental rights presented by the exponential growth of big data and uncontrolled retention and exploitation of this information. Developing a digital market cannot come at the expense of citizens' rights. In this sense, I agree with the European data protection supervisor that it is a shame the EU does not have a holistic approach in this area. Data protection seems to be subject to heterogeneous and even contradictory considerations, both by public authorities and market stakeholders. The EU has just adopted new data protection legislation. This must be applied everywhere - on all territories and in all sectors - by everyone and for everyone. I am particularly worried by what is happening in my own country, France, where a special folder is being set up to collect the biometric data of some 60 million French citizens. Commenting on the matter, the Commission said that the new EU data protection rules would not be applicable until May 2018. This is worrying. It is therefore important that Parliament's civil liberties committee pointed out that big data concerns both the public and private sectors, and that the rules apply to all - including older systems - without, however, jeopardising freedom of expression. These days, everything seems to have become 'smart' - cities, borders, objects. This is questionable, given the huge consequences a technical error could have on someone's life if the necessary precautions are not taken in terms of privacy rights, data protection, freedom of expression and non-discrimination. For some, digital represents a sort of magical Eldorado. However, this is far from the case and many of its implications are still unknown. We must be cautious. We cannot store and analyse data without considering all the possible consequences, particularly the risk of profiling. We should avoid proving George Orwell right; now is the time to act. "}

At the same time, local authorities and governments are doing their best to meet key sustainability goals, including environmental objectives. As part of this picture, transport contributes greatly to regional growth, benefiting local economies and people, helping to access jobs and education. Nevertheless, commuting to work or for leisure represents a large amount of time spent in traffic and huge costs for individuals, businesses and the society as a whole. This is particularly the case for densely populated regions and big cities, where transport authorities often have the challenges of increasing demand for mobility and a saturated road network. Since the 1990s, European governments have levied lower taxes on diesel than on gasoline, thinking that diesel was a cleaner alternative. However, while less carbon emission is better for the planet, diesel cars emit nitrogen dioxide (NO2) harmful to human health and tiny particulates that can harm the lungs. Regrettably, despite diesel fuel use being a key cause of air pollution, diesel consumption has been rising in many countries, partly for economic reasons and partly as a measure to combat climate change. Recent research has shown that NO2 pollution causes approximately 5900 early deaths every year in big cities, such as London. Moreover, the World Health Organisation estimates that outdoor air pollution generally led to some three million premature deaths worldwide in 2012. There is without doubt an urgent need to reduce the use of diesel-powered vehicles, and to shift towards alternative solutions. The EU has set ambitious targets that could help into that direction: by 2030 to halve the use of 'conventionally fuelled' cars in urban transport, and to eliminate their use by 2050. In addition, with regard to sustainable urban mobility, the aim is to achieve essentially carbon-free movement of goods by 2050. Although achieving sustainable mobility in the EU has long been a goal for centre-left politicians, sufficient funding and investment has been lacking. Some cities have already adopted measures intended to reduce congestion and clean up the air, such as low-emission zones that involve traffic restrictions. Others, such as Madrid, Paris and Athens have pledged to ban polluting diesel cars from their centres by 2025, deploying clean vehicles in a smart and multi-modal manner. The Ile-de-France region is currently working to complement public transport with novel electric vehicles sharing services, in combination with several train stations. Consequently, electric mobility has never been closer to the mainstream, with the market being pushed ahead by a wide array of new electric car models from established car firms. Nevertheless, the market is still emerging and the impact of electric mobility on the grid today is limited. For a long time the use of electric cars was conditioned by battery technology limitations. Today other problems need to be resolved, such as recharging infrastructure and integration of charge stations into electrical networks. Therefore, although it is good news for the environment that the EU sales of electric cars are rising, and in the long-term the gap between the cost of combustion and electric engines will significantly decrease, this trend is unlikely really to take off without a more strategic and well-resourced policy regarding electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Ideally, all relevant authorities should be further encouraging and supporting development of electric vehicles and recharging infrastructures in and around urban areas, providing necessary facilities in public areas; companies should also invest in providing premises and surroundings with specific infrastructure for their employees. As for individual users, we should integrate alternative car ownership schemes, such as vehicle-sharing and pooling, with public transport in a multi-modal approach, benefiting the users of both. For example, users could easily access electro-mobility platforms, which could be available at several stations, take a pre-booked electric vehicle or book one on the spot. Finally, we need to keep up the pressure on manufacturers to switch to producing more gas, hybrid and electric cars, and help them modify the diesel cars they have already produced to limit pollution. It is clear that EU focus and funding is a helpful catalyst, but national, regional and local authorities must do so much more to achieve the levels of investment and support required. As it is usually the case with the transport sector, this is a complicated issue, linked closely with planning and wider development policies. "}

Ransomware viruses like WannaCry and Petya are making headlines, crippling banks utilities, telecom operators and even national health services, as was the case in the UK. Martina Werner, who is a member of the Parliament\u2019s industry, research and energy committee, points out that there was a fivefold increase in the economic damage caused by cybercrime between 2013 and 2017. The German S&D group MEP also highlights that in 2016, there were 300 per cent more ransom ware attacks than in 2015. Werner says, \u201cCybersecurity has now become a very hot topic over the past few years, due mainly to the digitalisation of our society and economy and we will likely to see a continuation of this trend.\u201d She points out that many small and medium sized companies lack the knowledge and resources to cope with this threatening digital environment and thus \u201cmuch too often refrain from moving their digitisation safety strategy forward.\u201d With the EU having presented a new cyber security strategy in September, Werner says, \u201cI welcome the proposals the Commission has put on the table. It is a solid basis for discussions.\u201d However, the deputy has identified three key weaknesses. \u201cWe need a stronger emphasis on the support of SMEs. \u201cWe need to overcome the widespread silo mentality in larger companies and sectors regarding cybersecurity that is counterproductive to a resilient digital economy. \u201cFinally, the WannaCry attack in May 2017 and the rise of scam tactics such as \u2018Fake President\u2019 clearly show that criminals increasingly turn to methods that systematically exploit human weaknesses. \u201cWe need a robust link between the EU cybersecurity strategy and e orts to boost IT skills.\u201d Monica Macovei, who sits on Parliament\u2019s civil liberties, justice and home affairs (LIBE) committee, stresses the scale of the problem Europe now faces, saying, \u201cThe economic and day-to-day impact of cyber-crime in our lives is overwhelming. We face unprecedented threats coming from cyberspace, governed by almost no rules.\u201d The Romanian ECR group deputy points out that \u201c87 per cent of our European citizens state that they regard cyber-crime as a significant challenge to the EU\u2019s internal security.\u201d She adds, \u201cIt\u2019s high time we stepped forward with a strong package of measures to protect citizens, institutions and our security.\u201d For Macovei, the key to success for the EU\u2019s new cybersecurity \u201cdepends on solid regulation, speedy implementation, proper allocation of resources and very tight collaboration between member states.\u201d She also says, \u201cWe need to move on with this part of the Union security agenda here and now. We can only do it if, while increasing the EU\u2019s cybersecurity capacity and building a stronger EU cybersecurity agency, we are capable of truly creating that effective criminal law response mentioned in the new strategy.\u201d S&D group MEP Carlos Zorrinho fully supports the new strategy saying, \u201cIt can lead to robust protection of European businesses and citizens.\u201d However, the Portuguese deputy warns that in the rush for stronger security, \u201cThere is a huge risk of privacy rights being invaded in the name of cybersecurity. \u201cThe European Union must lead a response, combining assurances of security and privacy, as part of its affirmation strategy in the new digital society and in the new economy based on data and its valuation. The strategy presented is a first step in this direction.\u201d His Maltese colleague Miriam Dalli welcomes the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)\u2019s new mandate received, as it will \u201cmost definitely help coordinate efforts\u201d in cyber-defence. Still, she warns, \u201cI still believe that European citizens need more assurances with regards to security against large scale cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure, such as in the case of the WannaCry attack.\u201d In her opinion, \u201cThe EU still needs to equip itself in two ways - first by ensuring member states and the EU as a whole have the right security tools in place, and second by using innovation to combat the phenomena.\u201d The MEP also believes young people, especially those learning code and computer science, should be recruited to \u201cto bring then on the right side of the fight against cybercrime.

Decarbonising our energy system and creating a sustainable economy powered by renewable energy will not only contribute to reversing global warming, but create new jobs. Europe's energy union offers a vision that economic growth is not incompatible with environmental protection. Making the energy union work will bring down energy bills, create jobs, make Europe the leader in energy technology and help re-engage citizens in the European project. The EU is making strides to reach its energy and climate targets by 2020 but more needs to be done. We need to keep supporting eco-innovation technologies and businesses, providing the necessary legal frameworks, fiscal incentives, funding programmes and binding targets to ensure we move the energy union agenda forward. And this can't be achieved without the strong role of cities and regions. There is an investment gap which needs to be resolved to unleash the potential of the energy union. Investment levels in Europe have dropped by 15 per cent over the last decade. Ageing infrastructure and insufficient investment in digital and ecological transition is not only slowing down recovery but threatens Europe's competitiveness and future potential to grow and innovate. Better synergy between the EU's \u20ac80bn Horizon 2020 programme and \u20ac325bn in regional development funds can play an essential role in achieving the energy union targets. We need to build up local and regional innovation ecosystems with improved access to the best energy-efficient technologies - such as consumer-driven integrated heating and cooling systems. Nevertheless, it is estimated that an extra \u20ac177bn of investments per year from 2021 to 2030 is needed and public funds will never be enough. Regions and cities need more knowledge and support to take advantage of the European fund for strategic investment (EFSI). Take for example a project being carried out by the \u00cele-de- France region in France, where a \u20ac100m EIB loan aims to improve the energy efficiency of 8000 to 10,000 homes by 50-70 per cent. This project is expected to generate work to the tune of \u20ac200-300m and create 2000 to 2500 jobs. We need to use funds to boost decentralised energy installations and smart control and transport systems. Cities and regions should be encouraged to develop systems and technologies for decentralised energy production as this mitigates against monopolies developing in the energy sector and helps secure greater involvement of the public. We must ensure market access and grid connection to small local and regional renewable energy providers. The review of the directives on energy efficiency and energy performance of buildings, access to finance and capacity building should be easier for local and regional authorities. I come from Finland, where we already have several apps to support citizen-driven activities such as showing house buyers the energy efficiency of the property or how many years it takes to cover the costs of installing solar panels in your roof. We need to put energy efficiency first and deploy all financial instruments for sustainable energy and energy efficiency investments. The energy union needs a governance structure that brings cities and regions to the table so they can share their experiences and fine-tune delivery. The foundations are already there: over 7000 Mayors representing over 200 million European citizens have already committed to the Covenant of Mayors, making efforts to be energy efficient and sustainable. Failure to formally recognise and involve local and regional governments in the energy union could put both European and national energy climate targets at risk. The European Commission has recognised that the energy transition is simply impossible without our Mayors, Presidents of regions and Councillors, yet we need a clearer plan to engage local and regional authorities in planning and implementing climate change and energy policies. This is well accepted, however - crucially - we need to speed up experimenting, testing, piloting and scaling-up throughout Europe. We need more ambitious targets. The EU should upgrade its own commitments of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent instead of 40 per cent by 2030 compared to 1990. We should aim for a carbon neutral world by 2050. By investing smart and thinking green we can definitely show the world that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand for the benefit of our societies. But it needs to be closer-to-people and closer-to-resources. Greater energy efficiency can only be achieved if we introduce better regulatory and financial conditions. This means providing the right financial resources at European, national, regional and local level backed with the right mix of funds, energy performance contracts and public-private partnerships. Above all, it needs regions and cities to be part of the game and be a major player in the process. "}

Smart cities improve people's lives - from finding parking spots or avoiding traffic jams to saving energy in buildings. Using digital technology in cities will lead to better quality of life, more growth in an innovative economy, and to a greener, more sustainable society. Ideally, the best way for a city to become 'smart' should be based on an open, competitive, and innovation-friendly approach and involve citizens. Furthermore, cities will be able to be more resource-efficient if they work together across Europe to share their experiences and learn from each other. As I wrote in a previous article for this magazine, there are well-developed smart cities in Europe but they are isolated. This is still the case, but we have made a lot of progress at EU level to change that. The European Union has continued to invest in ICT research and innovation and has developed policies to improve the quality of life of citizens and make cities more sustainable in view of Europe's 20-20-20 targets. Under Horizon 2020, almost 30 European cities now receive more than \u20ac200m of EU-funding to deploy and replicate other cities' solutions with a focus on energy, mobility and digital technology. Digitalisation of infrastructures and processes with a focus on citizens' needs is at the core of urban transformation. To ensure that such solutions are competitive, cost-effective and do not lead to a lock-in of users, there is a need for a certain level of openness and interoperability. The European innovation partnership on smart cities and communities has established cooperation of around 50 industry players and 100 cities called 'urban platforms', which aims at ensuring that necessary levels of interoperability and openness become the norm. This partnership is now bearing fruit: cities have developed and tested joint requirements for urban-platforms and they are working on supporting tools towards a fast roll-out of this key enabling technology. In addition, vendors have developed a first draft of architecture specifications that could lead to a common standard. These developments also demonstrate the emerging role of data as the main currency of a city economy, just like in the economy at large. In order to respond to the broader data challenge, the Commission launched a communication on the data economy in January. This is an effort to look at the rules and regulations that impede the free flow of data, and the initiative identifies cities as key drivers of the data economy in Europe. Mobility and transport are a key sector of urban activity and an area that is undergoing fast transformation with vehicle automation and connectivity being core elements of this development. Its impact on cities is expected to be revolutionary, for example with new modes of mobility, more efficient energy use and space allocation, and less congestion. These initiatives run in parallel with other important actions like creating connectivity for a European gigabit society that includes the 5G action plan, or our efforts on the Internet of Things. They all represent core technologies and platforms in city infrastructures and economies and they are closely linked to our objective of establishing the 'once only principle' for public administrations online. The coming months will be busy with making progress on the implementation of all above-mentioned activities. We need to ensure that cities firstly play a driving role in putting forward requirements and testing new solutions and, secondly, benefit fully from relevant technological developments. The challenges for cities have increased drastically over the last few years but the digital tools at their disposal have never been better. A strategic approach with a clear focus on their individual needs can make their efforts pay off. However, only joint action and demand aggregation can produce faster, better and cheaper solutions with improved returns and benefits. We encourage all actors in Europe to further cooperate and engage to reap the benefits of the potential that smart cities offer. "}

But if you allow yourself to go back just a few months, I'm sure you can still feel the gentle blow of freezing air from underneath your door. In many houses in Brussels, as well as in other parts of Europe, thin walls, single glazed windows and 50-year-old radiators ensure that if you're planning to spend some time at home without a ski jacket, your energy bill will be huge. There are differences between the member states of course. Not everyone has to be prepared for winter days of -30 degrees Celsius like I do back home in Finland. Still, the magic word in all of Europe is 'heating'. Despite what some in the southern member states might think, all European countries - save for Malta - use a lot more energy to heat up their house in the winter, than they do to cool it down in the summer. I'm a shadow rapporteur on the energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD), currently being discussed in the industry, research and energy committee. Buildings are responsible for 40 per cent of energy consumption and 36 per cent of CO2 emissions in the EU. We now aim to reduce Europe's energy consumption and increase the use of energy from renewable sources. By improving the energy efficiency of buildings, we could reduce total EU energy consumption by five to six per cent per cent and lower CO2 emissions by about five per cent. This in turn will slow down climate change. With US President Donald Trump unwilling to protect the planet, Europe has to take an even stronger lead in saving humanity. Net zero energy buildings are one of the best ways to reach CO2 emissions goals, but we won't get results simply by building new energy efficient houses. Decarbonising the building stock is very slow if we only build new houses. Member states need to present long and medium term strategies for speeding up energy efficiency by renovations. We also need a holistic approach: houses are part of a bigger picture within so-called smart cities. An ambitious EPBD will also create jobs and growth. So, what is it that we want? In short, buildings need to be more energy efficient in the future. This, in turn, requires the people involved in the design and construction of houses are trained and pushed to make energy efficient houses, and that it is possible to monitor energy usage. It was previously agreed that new public buildings must have nearly zero energy inefficiency by 2019 and all new buildings by 2021. Now we have to start thinking about renovations. Member states must set minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings and for the major renovation of buildings as well as draw up lists of national financial measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. We'd like to see big non-residential developments equipped with building automation and control systems by 2023. These systems will monitor and analyse energy usage, make sure that heating, cooling and ventilation work as they should and adjust energy usage, so that at every moment a minimum amount of energy is used. The payback time of such investments is only a few years. There are also still low hanging fruits to be picked, like introducing more radiator valves with thermostats, which are still not obligatory in some member states - and have been in use since the 70s in others. In addition, the directive will include regulation for electric car charging points, a big step towards carbon-free traffic. I see this as an opportunity to reach charging infrastructure for electrical driving in a cost-effective way. Once major renovations take place, installing cables or ducts for charging stations is the most cost-effective triggering point. Charging points for electric cars have to be installed in new non-residential buildings and in existing buildings undergoing substantial renovation. As for residential buildings, re-cabling for electric recharging will have to be installed. We also have the opportunity to address problems that are present in everyday life. Poor indoor environment quality afflicts too many houses and contributes to making people ill. Today, energy efficiency is often a privilege enjoyed by people who are rather well-off. The poor can't afford to switch household appliances to more energy efficient models or renovate their house to have better insulation. They won't build solar panels or geothermal heat pumps but try to afford big oil bills. Poor people live in older houses - about 35 per cent of the EU's buildings are over 50 years old - and while new buildings need fewer than three to five litres of heating oil per square metre per year, older buildings consume about 25 litres on average. About 15 per cent of EU citizens, in some member states more than 30 per cent of people, live in a dwelling with a leaking roof, damp walls, floors or foundation, or rot in window frames. About 10 per cent can't afford to keep their home adequately warm. The EU has to make sure that all the citizens will benefit from energy efficiency and that the member states allocate enough money to renovations all across society. "}

The powerful Loma Prieta earthquake, the most destructive to hit the region in more than 80 years, felled entire apartment buildings. Freeway overpasses shuddered and collapsed, swallowing cars like a sandpit. Sixty-three people were killed and thousands injured. And local Soviet spies, just like many other denizens of the Bay Area, applied for their share of the nearly $3.5 billion in relief funds allocated by President George H.W. Bush. FBI counterintelligence saw an opening, recalled Rick Smith, who worked on the Bureau\u2019s San Francisco-based Soviet squad from 1972 to 1992. When they discovered that a known Soviet spy, operating under diplomatic cover, had filed a claim, Smith and several other bureau officials posed as federal employees disbursing relief funds to meet with the spy. The goal was to compromise him with repeated payments, then to turn him. \u201cWe can offer your full claim,\u201d Smith told the man. \u201cCome meet us again.\u201d He agreed. But the second time, the suspected intel officer wasn\u2019t alone. FBI surveillance teams reported that he was being accompanied by a Russian diplomat known to the FBI as the head of Soviet counterintelligence in San Francisco. The operation, Smith knew, was over \u2014 the presence of the Soviet spy boss meant that the FBI\u2019s target had reported the meeting to his superiors \u2014 but they had to go through with the meeting anyway. The two Soviet intelligence operatives walked into the office room. The undercover FBI agents, who knew the whole affair had turned farcical, greeted the Soviet counterintelligence chief. \u201cWhat,\u201d he replied, \u201cYou didn\u2019t expect me to come?\u201d We tend to think of espionage in the United States as an East Coast phenomenon: shadowy foreign spies working out of embassies in Washington, or at missions to the United Nations in New York; dead drops in suburban Virginia woodlands, and surreptitious meetings on park benches in Manhattan\u2019s gray dusk. But foreign spies have been showing up uninvited, to San Francisco and Silicon Valley for a very long time. According to former U.S. intelligence officials, that\u2019s true today more than ever. In fact, they warn \u2014 especially because of increasing Russian and Chinese aggressiveness, and the local concentration of world-leading science and technology firms \u2014 there\u2019s a full-on epidemic of espionage on the West Coast right now. And even more worrisome, many of its targets are unprepared to deal with the growing threat. Unlike on the East Coast, foreign intel operations here aren\u2019t as focused on the hunt for diplomatic secrets, political intelligence or war plans. The open, experimental, cosmopolitan work and business culture of Silicon Valley in particular has encouraged a newer, \u201csofter,\u201d \u201cnontraditional\u201d type of espionage, said former intelligence officials \u2014 efforts that mostly target trade secrets and technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a very subtle form of intelligence collection that is more business connected and oriented,\u201d one told me. But this economic espionage is also ubiquitous. Spies \u201care very much part of the everyday environment\u201d here, said this person. Another former intelligence official told me that, at one point recently, a full 20 percent of all the FBI\u2019s active counterintelligence-related intellectual property cases had originated in the Bay Area. (The FBI declined to comment for this story.) Political espionage happens here, too. China, for example, is certainly out to steal U.S. technology secrets, noted former intelligence officials, but it also is heavily invested in traditional political intelligence gathering, influence and perception-management operations in California. Former intelligence officials told me that Chinese intelligence once recruited a staff member at a California office of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, and the source reported back to China about local politics. (A spokesperson for Feinstein said the office doesn\u2019t comment on personnel matters or investigations, but noted that no Feinstein staffer in California has ever had a security clearance.) At the Aspen Security Forum last week, FBI director Chris Wray acknowledged the threat Chinese spying in particular poses, saying, \u201cChina from a counterintelligence perspective represents the broadest, most pervasive, most threatening challenge we face as a country.\u201d Making it even more complicated, said multiple former U.S. intel officials, many foreign intel \u201ccollectors\u201d in the Bay Area are not spies in the traditional sense of the term. They aren\u2019t based out of embassies or consulates, and may be associated with a state-owned business or research institute rather than an intelligence agency. Chinese officials, in particular, often cajole or outright threaten Chinese nationals (or U.S. citizens with family members in China) working or studying locally to provide them with valuable technological information. \u201cYou get into situations where you have really good, really bright, conscientious people, twisted by their home government,\u201d said a chief security officer at a major cloud storage company whose company maintains sensitive government contracts. U.S.-based Chinese employees of this company have had Chinese government officials attempt to \u201cleverage\u201d these individuals\u2019 family members in China, this person told me. The company now requires employees working on certain projects to be U.S. citizens. And yet, it\u2019s not clear that the Bay Area \u2014 historically famous for its liberalism, and now infamous for its madcap capitalism \u2014 is prepared to handle this escalation and these new tactics. Tech firms, especially start-ups, lack incentives to report potential espionage to U.S. officials;and businesses and universities are often ignorant about the espionage threat, or so attuned to local political sensitivities they may fear being accused of stereotyping if they attempt to institute more stringent defensive security and screening measures. As Silicon Valley continues to take over the world, the local spy war will only get hotter \u2014 and the consequences will resonate far beyond Northern California. This story is based on extensive conversations with more than half a dozen former intelligence community officials with direct knowledge of, or experience with, U.S. counterintelligence activities in the Bay Area. All requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters more openly. A few other individuals, all of whom worked counterintelligence in the Bay Area from the early 1970s through the mid-2000s, agreed to be interviewed on the record. As one former senior intelligence official put it: \u201cSan Francisco is a trailblazer \u2014 you see the changes there in foreign counterintelligence first. Trends emerge there.\u201d If we want to understand a world where Russian and Chinese are ramping up their spy games against the United States, then we need to pay attention to what\u2019s happening in San Francisco. * * * Russian intelligence has had an intensive interest in San Francisco stretching back to the beginning of the Cold War. In those days, the Russians were primarily gathering information on local military installations, said former officials, including the Presidio, the strategically located former military base set on a wind-swept northern tip of the San Francisco peninsula, overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. Since then, Russian operations have become bolder, with one notable exception: the immediate post-Cold War period. \u201cThe only time there was a collective sigh regarding Russia, like maybe things have changed, was under Gorbachev,\u201d said LaRae Quy, who worked on Russian and Chinese counterintelligence in the Bay Area from 1985 to 2002. \u201cWe even put in a big \u2018Going Out Of Business\u2019 sign in the Palo Alto squad room.\u201d But this optimism quickly faded when Putin was elected in 2000, recalled Quy, who retired in 2006. \u201cRussia has been steadily escalating since then.\u201d As the Bay Area transformed itself into a tech hub, Russia adapted its efforts accordingly, with Russian spies increasingly focused on obtaining information on valuable, sensitive or potentially duel-use technologies \u2014 those with both civilian and military applications \u2014 being developed or financed by companies or venture-capital firms based in the region. Russia\u2019s espionage activities have traditionally been centered on its San Francisco Consulate, which was forcibly closed by the Trump administration in early September 2017. But even with the consulate shuttered, there are alternative vehicles for Russian intelligence-gathering in Silicon Valley. One potential mechanism, said three former intelligence officials, is Rusnano USA, the sole U.S. subsidiary of Rusnano, a Russian government-owned venture capital firm primarily focused on nanotechnology. Rusnano USA, which was founded in 2011, is located in Menlo Park, near Stanford University. \u201cSome of the [potential intelligence-gathering] activities Rusnano USA was involved in were not only related to the acquisition of technology, but also inserting people into venture capital groups, in developing those relationships in Silicon Valley that allowed them to get their tentacles into everything,\u201d one former intelligence official told me. \u201cAnd Rusnano USA was kind of the mechanism for that.\u201d Rusnano\u2019s interests, said this former official, have extended to technology with both civilian and potential military applications. U.S. intelligence officials were very concerned about contacts between Rusnano USA employees and suspected Russian intelligence officers based at Russia\u2019s San Francisco Consulate and elsewhere, this person said.\u201cThe Russians treated [Rusnano USA] as an intelligence platform, from which they launched operations,\u201d said another former U.S. intelligence official. (Rusnano USA and the Russian Embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.) Russia also employs older, tried-and-true methods locally. Intel officials have suspected that Russian spies were enlisting local high-end Russian and Eastern European prostitutes, in a classic Russian \u201choneypot\u201d maneuver, to gather information from (and on) Bay Area tech and venture-capital executives. Sex workers targeting executives at high-end bars and nightclubs such as the Rosewood Sand Hill, an ultra-luxury hotel located near many of Silicon Valley\u2019s top financial firms \u2014 infamous for its raucous, hook-up oriented Thursday nights \u2014 the Redwood Room, a tony bar located in the Clift Hotel in downtown San Francisco, and other spots have been identified as potentially reporting back to Russian intel officers, said another former official. \u201cIf I were a Russian intelligence officer, and I knew that these high-end girls were dragging CEOs of major companies back to their rooms, I\u2019d be paying them for info too,\u201d said this person. \u201cIt\u2019s that whole idea of concentric rings: You don\u2019t need to be on the inside, you just need somebody on the inside that you have access to.\u201d * * * Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election has given Putin\u2019s regime an outsized role in the national conversation on espionage. But talk to former intel officials, and many will say that China poses an equal, if not greater, long-term threat. \u201cThe Chinese just have vast resources,\u201d said Kathleen Puckett, who worked counterintelligence in the Bay Area from 1979 to 2007. \u201cThey have all the time in the world, and all the patience in the world. Which is what you need more than anything.\u201d (China's Embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.) Because of California\u2019s economic and political importance, as well as its large, well-established, and influential \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Chinese-American communities, the People\u2019s Republic places great weight on its intelligence activities here, said multiple former intelligence officials. Indeed, two told me that California is the only U.S. state to which the Ministry of State Security \u2014 China\u2019s main foreign intelligence agency \u2014 has had a dedicated unit, focused on political intelligence and influence operations. (China has had a similar unit for Washington.) And if California is elevated among Chinese interests, San Francisco is like \u201cnirvana\u201d to the MSS, said one former official, because of the potential to target community leaders and local politicians who may later become mayors, governors or congressmen. Their efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Sometimes these recruitment efforts have been successful. According to four former intelligence officials, in the 2000s, a staffer in Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s San Francisco field office was reporting back to the MSS. While this person, who was a liaison to the local Chinese community, was fired, charges were never filed against him. (One former official reasoned this was because the staffer was providing political intelligence and not classified information \u2014 making prosecution far more difficult.) The suspected informant was \u201crun\u201d by officials based at China\u2019s San Francisco Consulate, said another former intelligence official. The spy\u2019s handler \u201cprobably got an award back in China\u201d for his work, noted this former official, dryly. Or take the case of Rose Pak. Pak, who died in September 2016, was for decades one of San Francisco\u2019s preeminent political power brokers. Though she never held elective office, she was famous for making and unmaking mayors, city councilmen (or \u201csupervisors,\u201d as they\u2019re known in San Francisco), and pushing city contracts to her allies and constituents in Chinatown. According to four former intelligence officials, there were widespread concerns that Pak had been co-opted by Chinese intelligence, and was wielding influence over San Francisco politics in ways purposefully beneficial to the Chinese government. Another worry, U.S. officials said, was Pak\u2019s role in organizing numerous junkets to China, sometimes led by Pak in person and attended (often multiple times) by many prominent Bay Area politicians, including former San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, who died while in office in 2017. Political junkets are used by Chinese intelligence for surveillance (\u201cevery single hotel room is bugged,\u201d one former official told me) and collection purposes, as well as for spotting and assessing potential recruits, said former intel officials. (There is no indication that Pak herself participated in, or had knowledge of, specific intelligence-gathering efforts.) Concerns about Pak\u2019s links to the Chinese Communist Party occasionally percolated into local political debate, but the intelligence community\u2019s identification of Pak as a likely agent of influence for Beijing is being reported here for the first time. Occasionally, Chinese intelligence activities in San Francisco burst into plain view. Consider the story \u2014 and it is an incredible one, also told here for the first time \u2014 of the 2008 Olympic Torch Run. San Francisco was the only U.S. city to host the Olympic torch as it made its way, tortuously, to Beijing. And Chinese officials were very concerned about disruptions to the run by protesters, as well as in managing the image China projected to the rest of the world in the run-up to the games. So they decided to leave nothing to chance. According to three former intelligence officials, Chinese MSS and Ministry of Public Security (MPS) officers flew in to San Francisco from abroad for the occasion, joining suspected MSS officers based in the Bay Area. (At the time, the diplomat responsible for Overseas Chinese Affairs at China\u2019s San Francisco Consulate was a suspected MSS officer, said two of these former officials.) U.S. officials watched as Chinese intelligence officers filmed Tibetan monks on their march across the Golden Gate Bridge, and known Chinese spies surveilled a pro-Tibet rally downtown featuring Desmond Tutu and Richard Gere. Chinese spies also recorded participants in a Falun Gong rally in Union Square, and shot footage of protestors at the torch run itself. Most brazenly, said former intelligence agents, Chinese officials bussed in 6,000-8,000 J-Visa holding students \u2014 threatening them with the loss of Chinese government funding \u2014 from across California to disrupt Falun Gong, Tibetan, Uighur and pro-democracy protesters. (They even provided these students with a box lunch.) \u201cI\u2019m not sure they would have pulled out these stops in any other city, but San Francisco is special\u201d to China, said a former senior U.S. official. Counterintelligence officers possessed advance knowledge about some aspects of this operation and observed Chinese intelligence officers, who often wore earpieces connected to a radio, managing the movements of counterprotesters, directing blocs of pro-PRC students to intimidate, disrupt and overwhelm anti-Beijing protesters across the parade route. Chinese intelligence officers would \u201ccommunicate with each other, and say, \u2018We\u2019ve got three Tibetan monks about to do a reading on Pier 39 \u2014 I need you to move bloc A and bloc B to that location so we can drown them out,\u2019\u201d recalled another former official. \u201cSo they\u2019d move these groups around to prevent any protests along the Embarcadero.\u201d \u201cWe got pissed off,\u201d said the same former intelligence official, because the Chinese \u201cwere interfering with the free expression of opinion\u201d at the torch relay \u2014 their operation was, in essence, an effort by a hostile foreign intelligence service to forcibly suppress First Amendment activities in a major American city. Disagreements between the FBI and the State Department, which counseled a more restrained approach, prevented U.S. intelligence personnel from interfering directly in Chinese activities during the torch run itself, said this former intel official. (The State Department said it does not comment on intelligence matters.) The same source noted that U.S. intelligence officials did, however, pass information about the torch run to their Australian counterparts \u2014 the torch was later scheduled to pass through Canberra \u2014 which denied visas to some of the Chinese intelligence officers responsible for the melee in San Francisco. Chinese intelligence has long focused on surveilling, and attempting to control, Chinese nationals studying abroad. One well-documented mechanism for this effort has been the use of Chinese Students and Scholars Associations groups on university campuses. The connectivity between individual campus CSSAs and local Chinese diplomatic facilities varies. Some groups are unreceptive to the intercession or influence of Chinese government officials, but many consider themselves to be under the direct \u201cguidance\u201d of their local consulate or embassy, receiving funds from these institutions. \u201cIntelligence officers in diplomatic facilities are the primary point of contact for students in CSSAs,\u201d said one former official. But some of these links between these student groups and Chinese officials are covert, and even coercive. In one case in the mid-2000s in the Midwest, a student affiliated with a CSSA reported another Chinese student\u2019s contact with the FBI to an MSS officer operating under diplomatic cover in Chicago, said a former intelligence official. The student was quickly flown out of the country. And, roughly half a decade ago in the Bay Area, counterintelligence officials believed that a graduate student affiliated with the Berkeley CSSA was working for the MSS, and reporting on the activities of other Chinese students on campus, said another former official. * * * When it comes to economic espionage in particular, Chinese intelligence employs a more decentralized strategy than Russia does, former intelligence officials told me. China draws from a much larger population pool to achieve its objectives \u2014 using opportunistic businessmen, ardent nationalists, students, travelers and others alike. One former intelligence official likened China\u2019s approach to an \u201cOklahoma land rush\u201d \u2014 an attempt to grab as much targeted proprietary technology or IP as possible, as quickly as possible, through as many channels as possible. Chinese intelligence also undertakes very intentional efforts to recruit insiders placed within organizations whose technologies they are interested in, said the same former intelligence official. \u201cThey are very good at softly recruiting people, and taking advantage of vulnerabilities\u201d \u2014 including via threats \u2014 \u201cand they are very patient in putting different parts of it together. We\u2019ve seen them repeatedly save money and time that the U.S. spends on research and development.\u201d The July 2018 arrest of Silicon Valley-based Apple employee Xiaolang Zhang, who allegedly stole proprietary information about Apple\u2019s self-driving car program to benefit his new employer, a China-based competitor, appears to fit this pattern. (Zhang was charged with theft of trade secrets and has not been accused of any espionage-related crimes. He maintains his innocence.) The case of Walter Liew, a Bay Area local who was found guilty in 2014 of selling a highly valuable proprietary pigmentation formula owned by DuPont to a state-owned Chinese conglomerate, is a clearer example. Liew was found guilty of violating the Economic Espionage Act,a landmark 1996 federal law that strengthened penalties for trade theft benefiting a foreign government. San Francisco has played an outsized role in cases involving this law. In fact, the first conviction under the act occurred in San Francisco, in 2006; as did the first sentencing under the law, in 2008; as did the first jury conviction \u2014 of Liew himself \u2014 in 2014. All three cases involved China. The Chinese have pursued this strategy \u201cbrilliantly\u201d for years, said Puckett. \u201cThey put all their efforts into espionage, and get everything for free.\u201d Chinese cyberespionage operations have also targeted a number of Silicon Valley-based technology giants. During a number of attacks, two former intelligence officials told me, Chinese intelligence immediately sought the files of U.S. companies\u2019 legal counsel or other legal documentation, to access Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants or National Security Letters previously issued to these institutions. In other words, the paramount Chinese interest was finding out the extent of the U.S. officials\u2019 knowledge about China\u2019s own intelligence operatives \u2014 and in adjusting their behavior accordingly. \u201cIf in fact the person in question was Chinese intelligence,\u201d said this former official, \u201cthey could then alter their approach.\u201d This strategy began being observed during a hack of Google , said two former officials, that occurred about a decade ago. While China and Russia demand the lion\u2019s share of counterintelligence resources in the Bay Area, a number of friendly intelligence services are also active in Silicon Valley, said former intelligence officials. South Korea, according to one, has become \u201cformidable\u201d in the realm of economic espionage, with particular sophistication in cyberespionage. U.S. officials have had to issue \u201cstern warnings\u201d to South Korea to \u201cstop hacking\u201d within the United States, said this person. (The South Korean Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to requests for comment.) Israel is also active in the Bay Area \u2014 but it\u2019s complicated. According to one former intelligence official, Israel has \u201ca culture that facilitates and encourages acquisition of targeted companies\u201d \u2014 in other words, it will use information it has gathered locally to cajole or incentivize private Israeli firms to purchase specific start-ups or other Silicon Valley-based tech companies. Throughout the 2000s, said former officials, French intelligence employed a similar strategy. In an email response, a spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., wrote that \u201cthe allegations are totally untrue and downright ridiculous. Israel does not conduct espionage in the United States.\u201d A spokesperson for the French Embassy declined to comment. There is disagreement, however, within the U.S. intelligence community about the amount of resources that should be devoted to what is, in essence, a \u201csoft\u201d form of spying by U.S. allies. \u201cI get they try to get advantages from economic espionage,\u201d said another former senior intelligence official, \u201cbut is French espionage worth that much emotional discharge, given what the Russians are up to?\u201d * * * There\u2019s another big challenge to doing counterintelligence work in the Bay Area, say these officials: getting the cooperation of local private-sector actors, especially in tech. Indeed, said former intelligence officials, not only do many cases of economic espionage not reach the prosecution stage here, they often go unreported entirely. This has been a longstanding source of friction in the Valley. \u201cThe biggest problem we had \u2014 really, seriously \u2014 with a lot of these companies is that they wouldn\u2019t prosecute,\u201d said Larae Quy, the former Palo Alto-based FBI counterintelligence agent who retired in 2006. \u201cThey would have an employee sell technology to, say, the Russians or the Chinese, and rather than let their stockholders or investors know about it, they just let it walk. So, we\u2019ve caught the guy, or we have information and we\u2019d like to take it to the next level, and they don\u2019t want to push it because of the bad press that gets out. It\u2019s the most frustrating thing in the world.\u201d Silicon Valley firms continue to downplay, or outright conceal, the extent to which the theft of trade secrets and other acts of economic espionage occur, said multiple former officials. \u201cComing forward and saying you didn\u2019t have controls in place \u2014 that totally impacts shareholder or investor value,\u201d noted one former intelligence official. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re dealing with startups or mid-level companies that are looking for funding, that\u2019s a big deal. You\u2019re basically announcing to the world, especially if you\u2019re potentially going forward with a public trial, that you were not able to protect your information.\u201d The open, start-up culture in the Bay Area has also complicated U.S. counterintelligence efforts, said former officials, because Russian and Chinese operatives have an easier time infiltrating organizations without any security systems or hierarchies in place. These services like penetrating young companies and start-ups, noted one former official, because \u201cit\u2019s always better to get in at ground floor\u201d when seeking to pilfer valuable information or technology. The exorbitant cost of living in Silicon Valley, however, means that opportunities for tech employees \u2014 and potential spies or co-optees \u2014 to \u201cget in at the ground floor\u201d are becoming increasingly uncommon. The tech industry, chasing talent and lower overheard, is now spread more widely across the country than ever before. And this diffusion will create new vulnerabilities. Consequently, places like Chapel Hill, North Carolina and Boulder, Colorado \u2014 both midsized cities with thriving tech industries \u2014 will likely see an uptick in counterintelligence cases. (One former intelligence official noted that the FBI\u2019s office in Austin, Texas, has built up its counterintelligence capacities.) But spies will never leave Silicon Valley. As the region\u2019s global clout grows, so will its magnet-like attraction for the world\u2019s spooks.

Sounds like China? Think again. Welcome to Berlin S\u00fcdkreuz railway station, where a German government experiment with facial-recognition technology is raising privacy concerns in a country scarred by a history of oppressive state surveillance. With its wide-open modern spaces and light flooding through a glass ceiling, Berlin S\u00fcdkreuz looks like an architectural metaphor for transparency. But critics say that authorities have been anything but transparent about the trial \u2014 launched last year\u00a0by the German interior ministry \u2014 taking place inside. In 2017, the ministry recruited around 300 volunteers who agreed, in exchange for a \u20ac25 Amazon voucher, to have their names and two biometric photos stored in a database and to carry a transponder around with them. This allowed authorities to know at what day and time they crossed through the station. On August that year, the project, known as \u201cSafety Station S\u00fcdkreuz,\u201d took off. Standing in front of TV cameras, then-Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re went into raptures about why \u201cvideo surveillance is very important,\u201d and how the new systems could eventually help police with tracing criminal and terror suspects. \u201cOn this scale, this is the first real-life test in Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to see the results so I can then provide a solid argument for using such facial recognition in the interest of protecting and securing the population.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for privacy advocates to cry foul. The ministry and its partner Deutsche Bahn have been coy about details; both denied to be interviewed.\u00a0But information from parliamentary inquiries and internal documents, as well as conversations with industry officials and technology experts, suggest that opposition is gathering momentum. Critics of the project\u00a0say it is insufficiently transparent and exposes citizens to invasions of privacy, especially\u00a0if their data is kept on file. \u201cThe worst part, really, is that so little information is being shared with us,\u201d said Constanze Kurz, a computer scientist and the spokesperson\u00a0of Chaos Computer Club, Europe\u2019s largest association of white-hat hackers. She said that while officials sold the project as merely an updated version of old-school video surveillance, this was an attempt to distract from the fact that everyone who passes through a marked section of the station has their face scanned. Legal experts add that if the technology on trial in Berlin S\u00fcdkreuz is ever deployed as part of an official law enforcement effort, it would violate German citizens\u2019 right to privacy. \u201cIf such technology was to go live, the state would grossly infringe the basic rights of its citizens,\u201d said Lea Voigt of the German Bar Association, which represents more than 64,000 lawyers, adding that \u201cthe technology that is tested has the potential to question in principle whether people can move anonymously through public space.\u201d The firms providing the technology \u2014 three companies from France, Spain and Israel \u2014 declined or ignored formal interview requests, but conversations with employees under the condition of anonymity suggest that the companies agreed to alter their software so that any data that does not lead to a match would be deleted immediately.  Surveillance states\n As facial recognition tools mature, governments around the world \u2014\u00a0from authoritarian regimes to democratically elected governments \u2014 are looking into making them available to their law enforcement. Most prominently, China has been turning more than 170 million cameras\u00a0into a gigantic surveillance system ; in Europe, countries such as the United Kingdom have also run real-life trials , on a much smaller scale. In Germany, however, experience with two surveillance states in the 20th century \u2014 the Nazi and East German communist regimes \u2014 has made people particularly sensitive about protecting their privacy. After the facial recognition experiment concluded in July, the trial\u2019s second phase inside S\u00fcdkreuz, to be supervised by private railway company Deutsche Bahn, is set to start in November and will test programs that can spot suspicious behavior in video footage by analyzing it in real-time \u2014 potentially opening another Pandora\u2019s box of privacy concerns. The programs will try to spot suspicious objects like unattended suitcases. They will sound the alarm when people enter areas where they\u2019re not supposed to go or lay down on platforms or staircases. They will keep count\u00a0of how many people are at the station. And they will watch out for unusual group behavior: If a large number of people, for example, abruptly starts to move in one direction, the program might see this as an indicator of a potentially dangerous situation. Legal scholars and technology experts say such software, which becomes ever-more effective by learning from its own experience, generally causes fewer privacy concerns because it tends to work without identifying people.  \u2018Historical amnesia\u2019\n Not everybody is convinced. A reply to a parliamentary inquiry into the program says that authorities are considering \u201cmarking\u201d people and objects as part of phase 2 of the project, allowing them to later reconstruct where a person moved inside S\u00fcdkreuz. To do this, it will be necessary to identify people, experts say, which suggests the use of facial recognition software. Supporters argue that Berlin needs to provide its law enforcement with access to cutting-edge technology so they can fight back against a growing threat by criminals and terrorists. \u201cI don\u2019t want to withhold certain instruments from our security agencies, just because of the diffuse fear that they could be abused,\u201d said Andrea Lindholz, a member of the German parliament for the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union and the chair of the Bundestag\u2019s powerful interior committee. Lindholz stressed parliament would have to pass respective laws and decide who can be monitored before the facial recognition technology is deployed as part of a law enforcement effort. \u201cThose who suggest in principle that our state would misuse any bit of information that\u2019s available to it suffer from historical amnesia and places today\u2019s Germany on the same level as the GDR,\u201d she said. \"We live in a functioning democracy based on the rule of law and with rules that everyone has to respect, which of course includes the state and its authorities.\" Attorney Voigt laughed bitterly when confronted with the argument. \u201cIf you follow this train of thought, then we wouldn\u2019t need the Basic Law [Germany\u2019s constitution] at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you could always say, let\u2019s just demand the people to trust the state.\u201d\u00a0But, she added, \u201cin particular if you don\u2019t suffer from historical amnesia and know the history of Germany, you know that there\u2019s no reason to have such basic trust in any state.\u201d  Mixed results\n Interim results from the\u00a0concluded facial recognition trial at S\u00fcdkreuz released by the interior ministry suggest that the experiment has so far performed poorly. Industry officials say that German sensitivities about privacy may be part of the reason why. Law enforcement has been experimenting with facial recognition for decades, but it is more complicated than it might sound: Faces look different from different angles and in different light. They age. People can put on glasses or hats; men can grow beards or shave them off. Recent developments in technology, particularly artificial intelligence, have allowed software to better compensate for some of those flaws. But experts warn that, no matter how refined technology becomes, facial recognition software, as we know it today, will only be able to identify people with a certain probability and remain prone to miss a match or identify people incorrectly. The published results of various recent real-life cases have exposed its limits:\u00a0When Welsh police trialed facial recognition during the June 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff, it wrongly identified 2,297 people \u2014\u00a092 percent of all hits \u2014 as suspicious. Similarly, the software used by local police in Germany\u2019s second-largest city Hamburg to analayze video footage of riots surrounding last year\u2019s G20 meeting ended up identifying just three people. Florian Gallwitz, a facial recognition expert at the Nuremberg Institute of Technology, described interim results presented by De Maizi\u00e8re in December 2017 as \u201cnot significantly better\u201d than the results of a trial conducted more than 10 years earlier in the city of Mainz \u2014 despite the fact that\u00a0technology has become \u201cdramatically\u201d more accurate at recognizing faces within the last decade. \u201cI consider the first phase as a clear failure,\u201d he said. One of the reasons, industry officials suggest, could be that they had to deploy their software under far-from-perfect\u00a0conditions. An employee of a company involved in the trial, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the interior ministry had made it a precondition that they would only use existing video cameras inside the station, without installing new or additional ones.\u00a0This, however, hindered the software from being fully effective, the employee said: Cameras were too far away from those they were supposed to identify. Their angles made it difficult to scan faces. And, in particular, many of them were directed against the light. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to fully exclude a certain margin of error,\u201d conservative lawmaker Lindholz acknowledged. \u201cBut this margin of error has to be as small as possible, so that we can say that, after carefully considering all legal and security aspects, it is justifiable to introduce this instrument within a limited framework.\u201d She did not specify where the threshold would lie, saying it would have to be decided by parliament. This article has been updated to clarify quotations attributed to Andrea Lindholz."}

On May 25, when Europe's General Data Protection Regulation comes online, companies active in Europe will become exposed overnight to the risk of massive fines and costs over data breaches and other privacy-related dangers. Some firms, like the social media analysis firm Klout or ad tech companies like Drawbridge , have given up before the fight even gets started. Several companies announced in the past few weeks they are ceasing all activities because their data-hungry business models have little chance of surviving in the era of GDPR. For every other company that relies on collecting data to stay competitive, this is the time to gear up for epic legal battles. The content of the new rules, which amount to the largest overhaul of global privacy regulations in 20 years, is well-known. But what remains to be seen is exactly what the rules mean, how they will be applied in each country, and what sort of entities are the most exposed to the risk of fines. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the enforcement environment will look like,\u201d said Trevor Hughes, president of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a trade group. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know.\u201d The scope for exposure to GDPR is vast: from next Friday, Europeans will have the right to ask companies what personal data they hold on them, and demand that the information be deleted from datasets. Companies will have to ask for approval and consent for using personal information for things like direct marketing. Settings on online apps and services will have to be privacy-friendly by default and users can ask not to be subject to a decision made by an algorithm. Companies will have to disclose data breaches to authorities within three days, or face crippling fines. Privacy activists are already sharpening their knives, ready to use their new rights against corporations starting on Friday. And data protection authorities, which until now have played an obscure role in law enforcement, will wake up with an array of new powers to start wielding. Here's a list of the companies and sectors that need to be most ready to face a barrage of legal challenges on the morning the GDPR is enforced across the European Union:  Facebook, Google and the rest of Big Tech\n Without a doubt, companies like Facebook and Google will be first in line when privacy groups start flexing their newfound muscle and filing legal challenges. Already, the French NGO Quadrature du Net has an online campaign to gather complaints and launch a class action lawsuit straight away on May 25. The group's target: \"GAFAM,\" or Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. Privacy activist Max Schrems' NGO \" None of Your Business \" is focusing on consent, particularly how tech companies require users to sign up to wide-ranging privacy policies if they want to continue accessing these digital services. The aim, Schrems told POLITICO, is to file at least two complaints with various European data protection authorities \u2014 but, notably, not the Irish privacy watchdog \u2014 to test whether such consent decrees are lawful under the region's new privacy standards. Schrems has already challenged Facebook before the Irish court several times, one of which led to the infamous \"Schrems judgment\" that annulled a previous EU-U.S. data transfer agreement known as \"safe harbor.\" Clearly, Facebook is in his crosshairs again, though he is likely to focus on other tech giants with similar privacy practices. The value of suing Big Tech is clear, said Arthur Messaud, jurist at Quadrature du Net. \"We took the players that are most visible,\" he said, adding: \"The first step for us is to illustrate what GDPR is, and what the class action system means.\" Facebook's Stephen Deadman, global deputy chief privacy officer, said: \"It comes with success that people will target you. We're reacting to make sure we're compliant.\" He added: \"We're not worried about Max Schrems. He'll do what he'll do.\"  Data brokers\n While big data companies are the obvious targets for privacy activists looking to take scalps in the new era of privacy enforcement, the whole ecosystem of data-trading companies is also under threat. Data brokers, who amass and (unlike Facebook or Google) sell large datasets of personal information for direct marketing purposes are especially likely to get hit with challenges. These firms gather data\u00a0\u2014 sometimes through physical tracking technologies, sometimes by buying and cleaning up smaller datasets\u00a0\u2014 and sell them to companies that can use it for direct marketing purposes or to complement their own datasets. \"Data brokers' businesses is slimy,\" said Andrew Keen, a prominent critic of technology companies. \"Data brokers are the vultures of the internet.\" Unlike the tech giants, these data brokers remain largely unknown to the public. The world's largest data brokers selling information to other businesses include companies like Axciom, Datalogix (owned by tech firm Oracle) and Equifax. The latter might ring a bell, but only because it suffered a huge data breach, revealed earlier this year and affecting 143 million people, mostly in the United States. The risk for GDPR violations is high, considering the data these companies hold is personal and sometimes sensitive and the conditions under which this data is sold and traded are murky. Data protection authorities including the U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office have launched investigations into their practices before\u00a0\u2014 cracking down on data brokers Verso and The Data Supply Company with fines for violating privacy rules \u2014 and you can expect them to do it again.  Carmakers, pharma and health care companies\n The GDPR has been on the minds of technologists and tech regulators for years, but the rules extend far beyond just the tech sector. As companies \"digitize\" their businesses, more and more are in the business of using data. Today, carmakers such as BMW, Volvo and others hold data on where their customers are located, and cars contain ever more sensors and code, storing data and preparing vehicles for automated driving.\u00a0Health care companies process and analyze plenty of sensitive data and hold medical records. Banks have always held large sets of personal data. Companies in these sectors, in time, will catch regulators' attention as they expand their databases. \"Particular industries will be more prone to enforcement actions than others,\" said Wim Nauwelaerts, top privacy lawyer at Sidley Austin. His top tip: \"The pharma industry and medical devices industry: I wouldn't be surprised if we see at least some targeted investigations in that industry.\"  The NSA, snoops and spies\n In all the cases against Big Tech, government surveillance services outside of Europe could become collateral damage. When Schrems sued Facebook for their transfers to the United States under safe harbor, his target was primarily the U.S.'s surveillance powers granted through national legislation\u00a0\u2014 or the lack of it\u00a0\u2014 governing the National Security Agency and its surveillance programs like PRISM. Facebook denies any cooperation with U.S. authorities on these programs. It shows how activists, and even the European Commission, try to curb invasive powers of foreign intelligence services by asking foreign companies to better protect data\u00a0\u2014 thus putting pressure on their governments to up their protections too. It's what academics and observers have called the \"Brussels Effect.\" An early example could be the U.K., where the country's Investigatory Powers Act is already causing EU policymakers to question whether Europeans' personal data can just flow to Britain. The U.K. is seeking a special deal on data flows after Brexit but could be prompted by the EU to build in safeguards on how it governs intelligence and security agencies.  Road to Luxembourg\n For the privacy activists and litigators, the fight will be won only if rules are enforced across the bloc\u00a0\u2014 and the world\u00a0\u2014 consistent with European fundamental rights. That means, for any case, the final scene is set in Luxembourg before the European Court of Justice. \"What we hope\u00a0\u2014 and we'll help others\u00a0\u2014 is that everyone does its own case, and\u00a0that all class action court cases in the end come together before the [European Data Protection] Board or before the European Court of Justice,\" said Messaud at Quadrature du Net. This could take time. Challenges to the EU's data transfer deal privacy shield are pending still before the EU's General Court, and other key privacy cases have taken several years on average to finish."}
{"_id": "587266261407195_1296709107129570", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "Privacy is power", "content": " LONDON \u2014 Privacy has never been more under threat. But strangely, it has also never been more alive. From increasingly connected and personalized spaces to the looming threat of ubiquitous facial recognition, we are faced with unprecedented threats from governments and companies, who can know more about us than was ever previously possible. Yet, at the same time, we are seeing the richest and most informed debate on privacy that we have ever had. And it\u2019s being carried out across the world. Just last August, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that privacy is a fundamental right for the country\u2019s 1.34 billion citizens. What\u2019s so fascinating about this renewed interest in privacy is that the narrative has evolved. Privacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it\u2019s understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people \u2014 and it\u2019s a necessary precondition for democracy. In an underregulated data ecosystem, people\u2019s most sensitive information is up for grabs. It merely takes five clicks on ExactData.com to download data on 1,845,071 Muslims in the United States, according to an investigation by Amnesty International. For 7.5 cents per person (or $138,380 in total) the data broker offers a file containing individual names, addresses and ZIP codes. The website also offers more fine-grained lists such as the addresses, phone numbers, email and social media accounts of \u201cUnassimilated Hispanic Americans\u201d or \u201cAmericans with Bosnian Muslim Surnames.\u201d And it\u2019s not just a problem in the U.S. In Kenya, for example, biometric data gathered for the country\u2019s voter registry may have been used by third parties to micro-target voters with WhatsApp messages. Precisely because so much is at stake, it is crucial to recognize that regulation is one of the reasons why privacy is more alive than ever. Companies aren\u2019t updating their privacy policies because they feel like it\u2019s a good idea \u2014 but because the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation forces them to do so. We now see one-page ads from large companies, not just embracing, but also celebrating GDPR, but it is often these very companies that have fought \u2014 and continue to fight \u2014 privacy regulation across the world. This is why GDPR is such a remarkable achievement. Across the world people are looking at the rights enshrined by Europe\u2019s data protection law and are asking why they don\u2019t get them too . There\u2019s the persistent misconception that data protection is a European concept. To the contrary, 126 countries around the world have national data protection frameworks. These are diverse, but they are all designed to protect individuals\u2019 data and reflect a judgment that such protections are an important aspect of the right to privacy. Still, the defense of privacy requires more than a strong data protection law. New technologies continue to challenge (and thereby undermine) existing legal protections. We see a troubling pattern in how police adapt new technologies. Every time there\u2019s a new technology \u2014 from surveillance devices targeting mobile phones to facial recognition to mobile phone extraction \u2014 there is a tendency for these technologies to be used without the necessary safeguards. Emerging privacy threats don\u2019t necessarily involve personal data and sometimes the harm is done not to individuals, but groups or entire segments of society. Data protection organized around the individual is not always able to effectively protect us all from these more collective harms. One example is emotion detection technologies that are employed in public spaces. They clearly pose a threat to privacy (among other rights), but don\u2019t necessarily fall under data protection. Ultimately, it\u2019s important remember that data protection is about power. Anyone who has ever tried to access their data quickly recognizes the profound informational asymmetries that characterizes today\u2019s data economies. From third-party trackers in apps that we cannot see to companies we have never knowingly engaged with brokering our information \u2014 the ad-tech industry has created an ever more complex ecosystem of thousands of companies that are in the business of tracking and profiling peoples\u2019 every move. If there\u2019s one positive outcome of the election targeting and interferences scandals of the past months, it\u2019s this: They may have served as a reminder to companies and governments around the world that data protection has to be about more than simply protecting data. It must seek to mitigate the inherent power imbalances between people \u2014 and those that collect, process and profit off their data.

The weakening of the American position comes after years of U.S. lawmakers and presidents, including both Donald Trump and Barack Obama, backing the tech industry's aversion to new regulations. The EU has stepped in to fill part of that gap, setting privacy standards that companies like Facebook and Google must follow. At the same time, China is dictating companies' security practices and demanding to see their products' source code \u2014 developments that experts say will undermine global cybersecurity. And while the global tech industry is adapting to these new realities, no one in the Trump administration has devised a clear plan to rebut either of these agendas. The result: Beijing and Brussels are effectively writing the rules that may determine the future of the global internet. And China's vision is spreading across the developing world as it influences similar laws in Vietnam , Tanzania and Nigeria . Experts in cyberpolicy say the trends could slow the internet's growth, stunt innovation and erect new market barriers for American businesses. \"The U.S. cannot afford to be on the sidelines,\" said Chris Painter, who was America's top cyber diplomat from 2011 to 2017. \"Other countries are doing things legislatively that affect the U.S.,\" said Painter, now with the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, \"and the U.S. is on the back foot.\" The implications extend beyond pure cybersecurity issues. China's law raises concerns about internet freedom, censorship and surveillance. The EU has placed an emphasis on citizens' privacy. But all these policies, experts say, affect America's ability to set the terms of global cybersecurity conversations. \"The U.S. model looks both paralyzed and somewhat feckless, while the Europeans and the Chinese are making progress and, in many cases, damaging the openness of the internet,\" said Adam Segal, director of the Council on Foreign Relations' cyberpolicy program. \"And we don't particularly have a coherent response to it.\" Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of Congress' leading voices on cybersecurity and technology issues, blames his colleagues for the U.S. predicament. \"The United States is failing on cybersecurity because our Congress has been captured by corporations who have successfully killed any effort to impose meaningful cyber standards,\" he told POLITICO in an email. \"Until lawmakers decide to put consumers ahead of corporations, Americans will continue to face more cyber threats, with less recourse, than people elsewhere in the world.\"  Losing ground\n For years, the U.S. pushed back aggressively when China and other authoritarian regimes tried to co-opt international venues to push their cyber agendas. In 2015, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan introduced a \" code of conduct for information security ,\" but behind-the-scenes work by the Western governments halted its momentum. The U.S. blocked similar efforts at a U.N. technology commission . And in 2010, the U.S. helped prevent a vote to give the International Telecommunications Union a role in internet policymaking. \"In all bilateral and multilateral encounters heretofore, the United States has successfully and consistently, in a bipartisan way, opposed\" authoritarian visions for cyberspace, said a former State and Commerce Department official who spent eight years working on cyber issues and requested anonymity to speak candidly. Meanwhile, the U.S. passed a cyber information sharing law in 2015 that gave companies legal immunity for sharing threat data with the government, and the technical standards agency NIST introduced a widely celebrated voluntary framework for managing digital security risks. Industry groups praised these efforts. \"A lot of those things get cascaded internationally through dialogues and other interactions that [U.S. officials] have,\" said Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council. But beyond these piecemeal, voluntary steps, the U.S. has advanced no coherent vision of cybersecurity regulation to counter the ones from China and Europe. And Russia will soon try again with its cybersecurity \"code of conduct.\" The U.S. is at a disadvantage, Painter said, because while China and others roll out ambitious new plans, American diplomats call for only modest reforms. \"If the U.S. line is, 'Leave the status quo as it is,'\" he said, \"that's always hard.\"  Beijing's grand vision\n In February 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke at the inaugural meeting of his new cybersecurity commission. \"Without cybersecurity, there is no national security,\" he said . \"Without informatization, there is no modernization.\" It was a dramatic preview of Beijing's growing ambitions. Communist Party leaders see cybersecurity \"as a fundamental part of their governance model,\" said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Not just in the tech space, but as it applies to the broader economy and national and social stability.\" Because cyber issues are so fundamental to Chinese stability, Xi has taken a personal interest in the topic, above and beyond how most world leaders engage with an issue that many still consider esoteric. Beijing's iron grip on domestic affairs gives it an advantage over the U.S. when it comes to laying down the law, literally and figuratively. Authoritarian governments \"face less pushback when promoting cyber regulations and governance policies,\" Amy Chang, a cyber expert at Harvard's Belfer Center, said in an email, \"and they are also better equipped at promoting these regulations/policies with a sense of unanimity and consistency.\" The result is China's cybersecurity law , which took effect on June 1, 2017, creating vaguely defined inspection regimes for network operators and critical infrastructure owners. These businesses must let Chinese officials test their equipment and software at any time. They must also store their data in China so investigators can access it. One provision could let Beijing demand companies' decryption keys, which would effectively ban the unbreakable encryption found in apps like Signal. But even as the fractious Chinese bureaucracy prepared to implement the law, Beijing was busy promoting its view of digital security controls abroad, focusing on developing nations that it hopes will join a coalition to counter the West's internet agenda. In a digital extension of its sweeping One Belt One Road initiative, China began spending vast sums to expand internet connectivity in small and underdeveloped countries. It donated computers to governments in nearly three dozen countries, from Pakistan to Malawi to the small island state of Tonga. Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that U.S. officials consider a cybersecurity risk, set up armies of security cameras in the Kenyan cities of Nairobi and Mombasa as part of its \" Safe City \" initiative. To cyber experts, the partnerships raised massive red flags. Behind China's generosity, they suspected, lay strategic self-interest: Beijing wants to have a foothold in these emerging countries' computer networks. Evidence has occasionally emerged to support this view. In January, the French newspaper Le Monde reported that China had spent years spying on the African Union, whose headquarters it built and donated to the international organization in 2012. Buried in the facility's ready-made computer network, the paper said, were backdoors letting Beijing monitor the African Union's activities. But for the most part, China's plan has gone off without a hitch \u2014 and other countries are starting to follow its lead. Vietnam recently passed a cybersecurity law that bears a striking resemblance to Beijing's. Tanzania and Nigeria, where China invested heavily in technological improvements, have done the same . \"China's influence is second to none in terms of its relationships with developing countries and in terms of its expanding relationship, recently, with developed countries,\" explained the former State Department official. As a result, they said, \"Chinese companies are essentially the lead [and] have inside access\" to countries' systems. China's restrictive model appeals to many countries that value what Sacks called \"a strong, top-down national articulation of, 'How do you govern in this essentially ungovernable space?'\" It is not a coincidence that many such governments face their own internal stability concerns. China will continue to press the attack, including at the ITU, which elected a Chinese official as its new secretary-general in 2014. Cybersecurity is expected to play a prominent role in the ITU's next major meeting this fall.  Europe enters the game\n While China has created the most headaches, the U.S. must also contend with the European Union. Despite shared values, Europe's strict regulatory regime poses a threat to the lighter-touch U.S. model. In August 2016, the EU enacted its first major cyber law, which requires \"operators of essential services\" to \"take appropriate and proportionate ... measures to manage\" their cyber risks. The EU is now considering another law that would task its cyber agency, ENISA, with certifying security products in EU member states. Both of these laws will force U.S. companies with European footprints to redesign their security measures to comply, and the more they do so, experts said, the more the EU position becomes the default. And then there is the EU's General Data Protection Regulation , which, despite being primarily a privacy law, has cybersecurity implications . The White House is reportedly preparing to introduce a GDPR competitor, but it may be too late. GDPR effectively kneecapped the U.S.' ability to set global privacy standards at a lower level. \"If you're a company,\" said the former State Department official, \"you have to abide by the stricter standard.\" The EU's size poses a significant challenge to the U.S. as it contemplates alternate approaches. Once EU member states agree on a cyber regulation, their status as a major international bloc makes it hard to propose a competing vision.  How to get off the sidelines\n The question for the U.S. is whether to abandon its insistence on a voluntary, industry-led approach and enact more bright-line regulations that reflect a clear U.S. vision. Many experts said the American tradition of letting the private sector shape the debate has undercut the U.S.'s standing globally. Other countries \"have looked around and said, 'Alright, this doesn't really seem to be accomplishing very much,'\" Segal said. One option would be to follow China and the EU in passing a sweeping national cyber law. If it took a light touch but still imposed rules, and if the U.S. could demonstrate that it improved security, other countries would take note. But as recent history shows, such a law stands no chance of passing Congress. James Lewis, a cyber expert at CSIS, said the U.S. was the only country where extreme distrust of government prevented meaningful cyber regulations. \"That's not how it works in the rest of the world,\" he said. \"And I say that for both democracies and dictatorships. This overwhelming angst we have about government is not reflected anywhere else on the planet.\" Naturally, industry executives say regulations aren't the answer. Chris Boyer, assistant vice president of public policy at AT&T, said the best \"opportunity for the U.S. to proactively lead this conversation\" lay in voluntary Internet of Things standards built around the NIST framework. But many security experts argue that isn't enough. \"These voluntary frameworks,\" Segal said, \"have not really, as far as we can tell, improved U.S. security significantly.\" Regardless of how the U.S. moves forward, experts said it must engage more aggressively in the international debate. \"We should try to provide a clear roadmap of the type of approach we want to see other countries adopting,\" said the former State official. \"Silence just cedes the ground to other views and other approaches that we fundamentally disagree with.\" Sustained engagement will require a strategy on the part of the Trump administration. For now, the former official said, U.S. diplomats attending these meetings \"don't say anything\" and are \"not relevant.\" The administration's cyber leadership void has exacerbated the problem. National security adviser John Bolton eliminated the White House cyber coordinator role, the central figure overseeing all U.S. cyber activities, and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson nixed Painter's top cyber diplomat role. A deputy assistant secretary of state, Rob Strayer, now manages cyber diplomacy, though a bill to elevate his office is nearing passage . The State Department did not make Strayer available for an interview about the U.S.'s strategy. \"The degradation or the removal of certain roles is hugely important,\" according to Kallmer, who said his meetings with administration officials often involve \"trying to reverse those things.\" China, meanwhile, has only increased the importance of cybersecurity in its bureaucracy, elevating its cyber regulatory body to commission status. The contrast between the U.S. and China in this respect is \"just comical,\" Sacks said. Lewis said he recently returned from conferences in Europe and Asia where allies told him, \"We can't wait for you people to make up your mind anymore.\" \"They would prefer us to lead,\" Lewis said. \"But they're not going to wait.\"  Looming policy 'contagion'\n If the U.S. doesn't step up, the course of global internet policymaking will change forever, experts warn. \"Extraneous issues\" like censorship would start \"driving cyber policy,\" said the former State official. There would also be a \"contagion of bad policy,\" Kallmer said, as more countries followed Vietnam in rushing to China's corner. Global confidence in the internet would suffer. \"How much can you trust this medium,\" said the former State official, \"if the rules ... are being set by a country that doesn't share our democratic values?\" The battle isn't over yet, and China's agenda still faces hurdles. For one thing, much of its cyber law has not yet been enacted, and different regulatory agencies are competing over how to implement it. Plus, Chinese firms that want to dominate global markets are pushing back on Beijing's attempt to balkanize the internet. \"There are constraints internally in China's system that are going to be a check on some of the more alarming parts of this vision,\" Sacks said. But even so, China is making a greater effort than the U.S., and the EU isn't far behind. \"For the first time,\" said the former State official, \"many, many, many countries ... rank much higher in influence than the U.S.\" Industry groups remain confident that the U.S. approach will eventually prevail. \"Existing U.S. leadership is pretty good,\" Kallmer said, \"and prospects for continued U.S. leadership are quite good.\" Lewis, reflecting on his recent conversations in Europe and Asia, was more pessimistic. \"The internet is going to be regulated, and it'll be regulated from Brussels and Beijing,\" he said. \"We're kind of out of it, because we don't have a good counter.\""}

The German chancellor had just returned from China, where she spent a day in the Shenzhen tech hub visiting companies like ICarbonX, an artificial intelligence (AI) startup focused on disease detection. A trained physicist, Merkel had been impressed by what she saw. The money and manpower China poured into AI left the 64-year-old with little doubt that the country viewed the technology as its key to becoming a global superpower. Germany, by contrast, had no plan for AI. So on her return to Berlin, Merkel met the country's top 32 AI experts at the chancellery to hear how the country was doing. Their assessment was sobering: Germany, they said, has a good track record in AI research, but it suffers from problems ranging from brain drain to a weak record in transforming basic research into real-world applications that are hampering its ability to compete in a new technology race. After three hours, Merkel left concerned \u2014 and made her worries public a month later. \"For centuries, or let\u2019s say since the age of Enlightenment, we in Europe were used to being the first ones to come up with technological innovations,\u201d she told a tech conference. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case anymore today. And this should worry us.\u201d  Crunch time\n he questions raised during Merkel's closed-door meeting are at the heart of Germany's technological predicament today. Though it has Europe's healthiest economy and a powerful industrial base, the country is at risk of losing its edge as China and the United States motor ahead in developing AI technology. Success or failure in the field is likely to determine which of the world's powers will dominate economically in coming decades. So Germany has no choice but to join the race. AI experts see reasons to hope that Germany can catch up: top-quality basic research, an industrial sector focused on exporting value-added products and a deep tradition of scientific inquiry. But to leverage such qualities into any form of AI dominance, Berlin must overhaul its approach to innovation by laying out a national vision, breaking down institutional barriers and fostering investment on a vast scale. None of that will be easy in a country still smarting from a political crisis that nearly toppled its leader, and which is now grappling with a potential all-out trade war with the United States that could hobble its car export sector. \u201cWe really do have to walk the extra mile to make sure we\u2019re not left behind,\u201d J\u00f6rg Bienert, the president of a new association representing more than 50 AI startups, said. Part of the problem in Germany, Europe's richest country, has to do with a lack of public and private investment, with local companies disadvantaged compared with overseas competitors. At the same time, leading thinkers are leaving for foreign companies and institutions, particularly U.S. tech giants. To reverse this trend, Merkel has tasked a working group in her chancellery to come up with an official strategy due to be published in November. A 12-page draft outlining the strategy's key elements, dated July 17, lists measures that Berlin hopes will attract more investment, keep experts in the country, turn \"AI made in Germany\" into a globally known seal of quality, and turn the country into \"the world's leading location for AI.\" But in more than two dozen interviews, the country\u2019s leading entrepreneurs, researchers, industry officials and policymakers said that political turf battles, bureaucratic hurdles and a lack of coordination are likely to get in Merkel's way.  Building a tech axis between Berlin and Paris\n o example illustrates the challenge better than limping efforts by Berlin and Paris to join forces in the race for AI. After Merkel's conservatives wrapped up their coalition talks with the Social Democrats in mid-March, they announced plans to set up a joint artificial intelligence center \u201ctogether with our French partners.\" But more than three months later, \u201cit\u2019s become clear that the \u2018grand coalition\u2019 has no well-conceived plan for it,\u201d said Anna Christmann, a German MP and the technology spokeswoman for the opposition Greens. While conservative Bundestag backbenchers, backed by regional state governments, are already swarming Berlin\u2019s government district to lobby for their constituencies as potential locations for the institute, Science Minister Anja Karliczek told POLITICO there are no plans to set up a single physical center. Instead, there would be efforts to \"organize networks on the national level in both countries and then connect them,\" she said. She is \u201cin close contact\u201d with her French counterpart, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vidal, she added, and the two ministers \u201chave very similar ideas when it comes to that.\u201d It's just one example of German-Franco initiatives that have, so far, failed to gather speed. Two days after Merkel won another term as chancellor in September 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech in the amphitheater of Paris\u2019 Sorbonne University, in which he called for the creation of a new European agency for disruptive technology. The suggestion was triggered partly by a proposal from a group called the Joint European Disruption Initiative, or JEDI, which had landed on his desk days earlier, according to Andr\u00e9 Loesekrug-Pietri, a German-French investor and the central force behind the initiative. JEDI, which has secured the support of more than 100 prominent European business and research leaders, is pushing Paris and Berlin to establish a \u20ac1 billion pan-European fund for major technological breakthroughs \u2014 so-called moonshots unlikely to become profitable in the near term. Merkel has embraced the idea, and signaled she wants to help get rid of bureaucratic hurdles like the fairly rigid profitability demands made by both Germany\u2019s National Audit Office and the European Court of Auditors for publicly funded projects. \u201cNot every investment can lead to a success story: Ninety or 95 percent of investment turns out to be not successful so that there can be one big invention,\u201d she said in June. \u201cWe have to push this disruptive way of thinking in Europe,\u201d she added. JEDI's Loesekrug-Pietri said, \u201cthe leaders, Merkel and Macron, they get it,\" adding that his group is planing to launch three to four challenges this summer. But, he added, the problem is that \"now it\u2019s bureaucracy and fights between different ministries that are slowing things down.\u201d  Turf battles in Berlin\n art of the reason why Germany \u2014 unlike France, the United Kingdom or Denmark \u2014 has not come up with its own national AI strategy is the political deadlock that paralyzed the country for almost six months after last September\u2019s election. When Merkel finally managed to form a government in the spring, she was eager to, this time around, prevent infighting between ministries controlled by different parties that had hindered many of Germany's digital policy efforts during her last term. She succeeded \u2014 to a degree. During the negotiations, the chancellor made AI and other emerging technologies part of her own portfolio, overseen by her chief of staff Helge Braun. On the operational level, Merkel set up a new department in her chancellery and put her longtime adviser Eva Christiansen at its head. And she secured two other key ministries working on AI for her Christian Democrats (CDU), making her confidant Peter Altmaier the economy mister and Anja Karliczek science minister. But once work on the AI strategy started, Labor Minister Hubertus Heil, a Social Democrat, insisted on having a seat at the table too. Now three ministries, held by different parties, are officially involved. \"To be frank, we have lost some time because of public discussions,\" Heil complained in mid-July, when he presented the strategy's draft with Karliczek, referring to a recent controversy between Merkel and her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) over migration policy that almost toppled her government. What\u2019s more, Merkel's longtime rival \u2014 Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who is also CSU party chief \u2014 managed to push one of his senior MPs, Dorothee B\u00e4r, into the chancellery by creating a new position of a \u201cstate minister for digitization.\" While government officials say that Merkel's chief of staff Braun, a 45-year-old anesthesiologist, and B\u00e4r, a 40-year-old political scientist, have been working well with each other, critics like the Green Party's Anna Christmann aren\u2019t convinced. Merkel hasn't gotten rid of what held many policies back during her previous term, Christmann said, but she has \u201csimply imported the turf battle that we saw between ministries during the last term into the chancellery.\u201d  How to enter the global AI arms race?\n o far, Germany and the rest of Europe, except the U.K., have mostly been watching from the sidelines as American and Chinese firms battle over who will dominate artificial intelligence. The U.S., where much of today\u2019s cutting-edge AI expertise is held by a handful of private tech giants, remains the world leader in the field. But China, which wants to become the world leader in AI by 2030, is catching up by boosting research, granting subsidies to companies and providing its AI industry with access to data on more than 1.4 billion citizens protected only by scant privacy laws. Aware of this \u201c AI arms race \u201d between Washington and Beijing, Merkel has become convinced the right way for Germany and Europe lies in the middle. \u201cIt's always been Europe\u2019s and Germany\u2019s strength that in our social market economy, it\u2019s never just the market or just the state that decides everything. Instead, the state sets the direction and guiding principles,\u201d she said in June, referring to the economic model that spurred West Germany\u2019s growth since the 1950s. \u201cThis is where Europe\u2019s strength could be once more, I believe: in finding the right balance.\u201d So far, however, Germany has achieved little when it comes to spurring private and public money for AI. While last year, the U.S. scored 66 percent \u2014 by far the biggest share \u2014 of global private investments in AI, Germany accounted for a mere 3 percent, according to consultancy Roland Berger . When it comes to public spending, Germany's research ministry spent a total of \u20ac0.5 billion over the last three decades (yes: 30 years), according to government figures. Compare that with the \u20ac1.9 billion China's capital Beijing is planning to spend on an AI development park in the city's west side alone. Merkel has pledged to bring these numbers up but experts caution that even if she manages to follow suit, money could flow into the wrong places. Stefan Heumann, the co-director of Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung (SNV), said he was positively surprised by the draft plan published in mid-July, which he said deviates from Berlin's previous path of focusing almost exclusively on ethics, regulation and how to boost research, by paying equal attention on how to foster the development of an AI ecosystem. \u201cBut a government has to be judged by its actions,\" Heumann cautioned. \"And it remains to be seen whether they'll actually walk the walk. This doesn't stop with making the necessary funding available \u2014 it also has to include implementing a range of policy initiatives, from developing data pools to training programs for workers.\"  Attack of the apps\n hose warnings have made their way all the way to the top of the chancellery, according to officials. The mid-July draft included various ideas brought up earlier this year by think tanks like the SNV or entrepreneurs, such as temporarily loosening regulation for AI developers, providing them with better access to data, or improving synergies between researchers and corporations to boost the development of AI applications. Part of Germany's plan is to become a world leader in business-to-business AI solutions connecting industrial supply chains: The country might have lost the race for consumer platforms to American tech giants, Berlin is convinced, but it can still become a world leader in those less visible applications for AI, many of which are still in a development stage. \"When it comes to how to economically use company data, process data and product data from complex supply chains ... which is proportionally a much bigger market, the competition is only just starting,\" the mid-July draft states. Wolfgang Wahlster, the director and CEO of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), said he believes Germany is already \"ahead by two to three years to our global competitors in that field.\" \"If we now 'inject' AI into those solutions, we will be the global leader,\u201d he added. But then there's the elephant in the room: big data. In a remarkable comment for a German chancellor \u2014 well aware of sensitivities regarding personal information in a country that had two authoritarian dictatorships in the 20th century \u2014 Merkel acknowledged in June that \"the fact that we have a difficult relationship to data ... has set us back.\" Along those lines, another idea floating around is for Germany to become a world leader in the next generation of AI that depends less on analyzing data. Much of today\u2019s cutting-edge AI depends on a machine-learning technology that works by finding patterns and correlations in huge troves of information. While such \u201cdeep learning\u201d opens opportunities across sectors \u2014 from treating cancer patients individually to enabling computers to communicate in spoken language \u2014 it's massively data-reliant. Germany, the idea goes, should focus on new AI approaches currently in development that go beyond deep learning, and need significantly less \u2014 or even no \u2014 data to be effective. Another path: providing companies and researchers with better access to anonymized public data. But investors and developers warn that time is playing against Berlin, and the EU more generally. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried about how slowly things are moving forward,\u201d said JEDI's Andr\u00e9 Loesekrug-Pietri. \u201cDecision-makers in Europe still need to understand that timing and speed are even more important than money.\u201d Merkel, who knows the disruptive nature of technological processes from spending more than a decade researching quantum chemistry before entering politics after the Iron Curtain fell, is eager to stress that she's got the message, warning in June that Germany's current wealth could make the country complacent and hinder innovation. \"We also have to ask ourselves: Considering that our society works relatively well, are we still curious enough to take the next steps?\" Merkel said. \"If we look to China, or to Silicon Valley ... it has to become our goal again to create creative environments like that,\" she added. The CEO of a Berlin-based AI startup, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that although he feels that decision-makers have \u201cfor sure\u201d been waking up to Germany's challenge, he remains pessimistic this will lead to a significant change in mentality. \u201cEvery day that we stick to our slow tempo here, we do damage to Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cThose damages won\u2019t be visible within the next one or two years,\u201d he added. \u201cBut in five to 10 years, there will be a bitter awakening.\u201d"}

Thanks to Laura Greenhalgh, Hanne Cokelaere and Mark Scott. WHEELS AND WINGS: I n our first Monday column, we'll tackle why Morning Transport is now Morning Mobility. The last century has seen a series of revolutions in how people get around. From tunneling under London in the 19th century to the construction of vast highway networks through post-war Europe, transport has never stood still. But the pace is change is accelerating, and the industry and its regulators are being forced to respond . What's new is that the paradigm is about combining everything from bike sharing to intercontinental flights to make the journey from A to B as seamless as possible. Companies are no longer segregated into road, rail, air or sea, and they recognize that revenue no longer comes solely from owning buses, planes, track and airports. The transition from transport to mobility also means greater choice for travelers and shippers, and more competition among providers. Even the most traditional industries are getting onboard. German rail giant Deutsche Bahn is trialing autonomous shuttle buses in deepest Bavaria while Italy\u2019s state train operator FS wants to take on stricken flag carrier airline Alitalia. The challenge for policymakers is to build a regulatory framework that keeps pace with technology and keeps Europe competitive against rivals in North America and Asia. What safety rules are needed for electric planes? What should be the standard communications protocol for connected and autonomous vehicles? Should drone pilots have to get training? What is the impact of tougher emissions rules on the future of the car? Those are the kinds of questions facing policymakers in Brussels and national capitals as they deal with the shift from traditional transport to mobility, and that's what we'll be tackling in Morning Mobility going forward. For a more comprehensive look at what's happening in European mobility and how policymakers and regulators are responding, read our story here , or below. GOOD MORNING\u00a0and welcome to our new look Morning Mobility. To kick things off we've got news on Britain\u2019s self-driving car plans and a take on how the splintered Brussels administration fails on mobility. We\u2019re also coming live to you this week from our second Connected Transport Summit in Brussels on Tuesday \u2014 so don\u2019t forget to tune in online or come along. On our radar today: The European Parliament\u2019s Transport and Tourism Committee meets for a session that will include a presentation by the European Court of Auditors on the bloc\u2019s failing high-speed rail initiatives . As Council attach\u00e9s in the land transport working group discuss the Mobility Package trucker rights files , green NGO Transport & Environment holds a mini-conference on how to best deploy renewables to power e-mobility, and bigwigs are in the bubble to talk batteries. BATTERIES \u2014 SEFCO\u2019S ALLIANCE HITS ONE YEAR: The European Commission is celebrating the first anniversary of its battery alliance initiative by bringing together ministers and\u00a0commissioners in Brussels today. The project aims to create a European cell production industry and provide an alternative to the Asian producers currently dominating the market for everything from electric vehicles to in-home storage. Progress has been slow, save for Sweden's Northvolt project. The anniversary comes as Germany looks at ways to offer state aid to potential producers of battery cells to fuel an e-push by giants like Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW, after the latter signed a \u20ac4 billion deal with China\u2019s CATL to build a cell production plant in central Germany. Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d has made the European alliance a pet project and said ahead of today\u2019s summit that \u201cpieces of [the] puzzle\u201d are falling into place. For him, it\u2019s a key issue back home in Slovakia owing to car production facilities which are vulnerable to turbulence in the electric vehicle shift. We\u2019re expecting the Commission to focus its one-year announcements on financing tools for countries and companies willing to start work. Who\u2019s in? \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s team is promising CEOs will be in town, along with state secretary-level attendees from Denmark, France, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Also coming is Hungary\u2019s Minister for Innovation and Technology L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Palkovics (who will be sticking around to join us at our POLITICO summit on Tuesday). Don\u2019t stop at cars: Internal Market Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska is getting in on the action too. \u201cE-cars are the standard example, but we're also already thinking about how the battery alliance could be useful for trucks, sea shipping and ferries,\u201d the Polish commissioner said ahead of the meeting. \u201cIf Europe wants to lead and compete with other big industrial players around the world, we need to hurry up.\u201d AVIATION \u2014 KUWAIT-CYPRUS OPEN SKIES: The Arab country agreed on a comprehensive air services agreement with its European counterpart, allowing greater freedom to airlines to travel between them. The agreement is indicative of how Europe\u2019s periphery feels the future of air travel should be moving toward full liberalization. As an island close to the Middle East, much of Cyprus\u2019s economy depends on air connectivity. For Nicosia, the more flights coming in (especially with well-heeled passengers) the better. Small piece of the puzzle: But the EU has had mixed success replicating such bilateral aviation agreements with the Middle East on a larger scale. The\u00a0United Arab Emirates signaled its willingness to get a deal only in August, two years after the EU28 gave the Commission a mandate to negotiate. The Commission is also in talks with Qatar with the intention to wrap up an agreement by the end of the year, but insiders say that\u2019s a \u201cvery optimistic\u201d deadline. CARS \u2014 BREXIT ROADBLOCK FOR SELF-DRIVING: The U.K. government has big plans to entice some of the world\u2019s largest automakers to its shores though lucrative incentives for driverless projects. But as one of those trials comes to an end in Milton Keynes, a commuter town one hour north of London, the plans are running headlong into a new roadblock: Brexit. Our colleague Mark Scott went to investigate. The full story here, or see below. LOGISTICS \u2014 DENMARK WANTS ROBO DELIVERY VANS: Denmark is pushing to change its rules of the road to allow slow-moving autonomous vehicles to make home deliveries for groceries and medicines. The vans would have a maximum speed of 6 kilometers per hour, according to the proposed amendment to the Road Traffic Act, which also sets details on vehicle dimensions and legal liability. \u201cI believe that the market and technology are ready for testing, in a safe manner,\u201d Transport, Building and Housing Minister Ole Birk Olesen said in a statement Saturday. Finland, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands are just some of the countries already trialing self-driving shuttle buses. AVIATION \u2014 ITALY\u2019S GRAND ALITALIA PLANS: Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio promised to invest from \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2 billion in state funds to \u201crelaunch\u201d the bankrupt national airline. The plan, he explained to Il Sole 24 Ore , would involve the government acquiring a stake of around 15 percent, with additional equity coming from national railway\u00a0operator FS as well as \u201can important international industrial partner,\u201d Di Maio said.\u00a0He promised to make an official offer by the end of this month. Crunch time: That\u2019s not the only deadline. The Commission might begin infringement proceedings against the Italian government if the \u20ac900 million it gave to the airline in emergency loans isn't repaid by December 15, according to Il Sole. Asked whether the plan to pump more money into the airline might run into trouble in Brussels, Di Maio said the company\u2019s been in touch with the Commission. \u201cWe are thinking of a threshold for the participation of the government that isn\u2019t different from other European cases. If France owns 14.3 percent of Air France, we can imagine a similar level of participation,\u201d he said. A Commission spokesperson told reporters Friday that Brussels was in contact with Italy but\u00a0wouldn\u2019t comment on the details. CARS \u2014 FINNS GET E-LICENSE TO DRIVE: Ever eager to forge forward with the digital revolution, the Finnish government wants to give motorists a digital version of their driving license from February. \u201cThe mobile driving license is a new way for drivers to prove their right to drive when required to do so during traffic surveillance,\u201d said Transport Minister Anne Berner. She\u2019s already launched a wholesale review of the country\u2019s taxi laws (which pleased Uber) and is restructuring the national transport administration. The plan for digital licenses needs to pass parliament. CARS \u2014 BRUSSELS ELECTION TRAFFIC CONUNDRUM: The EU capital held local elections on Sunday, but the vote isn\u2019t likely to solve the key mobility challenges faced by locals. The fractured Brussels administration means getting 19 communes to work together on boosting road safety, upgrading roads or building cycle lanes is nigh on impossible \u2014 a problem that\u2019s leading regional level officials to try to wrest control away from local officials. Our colleague Hanne Cokelaere has the story here, or scroll below. PIT STOPS \u2014 The key to autonomous driving?

The transport industry that helped create the modern world is being upended thanks to a combination of rapidly developing technology, the need to act to combat global warming and economic pressures. Instead of discrete silos, where rail companies, shipowners, carmakers and airlines had little to do with each other \u2014 and nothing to do with tech wizards \u2014 a world is dawning where all of these modes of transport and more are increasingly intertwined. That's forcing politicians and regulators to up their game. They have to work out how new fuel standards and emissions rules affect ships, planes and cars, set the standards for how locomotives, cars and trucks communicate with the infrastructure around them and establish safety regulations allowing them to eventually be driven without human assistance. \u201cThe technology exists, that's not the problem,\" said\u00a0Eduardo Dominguez Puerta, Airbus's head of urban mobility, on prospects for flying taxis \u2014 autonomous aerial vehicles for urban areas that can take off and land vertically \u2014 at this year's Farnborough airshow. \"The problems are public acceptance and regulatory requirements.\u201d That's a common complaint across industries in the transport sector where old divisions between businesses and technologies are increasingly blurred. Germany's state rail operator Deutsche Bahn (DB) operates autonomous shuttle buses in Bavaria while DB and SNCF face growing competition from low-cost upstarts of the kind that upended air travel. Italian state railway Ferrovie is looking to buy a stake in Alitalia. Hovering over all these sectors are new companies like Uber, Lyft and Finland's Whim \u2014 which promise to scrap traditional forms of car ownership and urban transport, forcing governments to rethink how cities are planned and function. As a result, places like Amsterdam are seeing transport in a new light. Instead of the 1960s idea of ramming expressways into the core of the city, the new vision calls for a seamless integration of bicycles, urban transport, railways, airports and cars \u2014 all designed to get people from A to B in as fast and non-pollluting a way as possible. All these modes of transport are no longer seen as separate and often competing sectors. \"From day one we've understood this is much more a national and market conversation than it is necessarily a EU conversation,\" Caen Contee, co-founder of U.S. mobility app Lime that's deploying bright green shared bikes and scooters across European cities, said in an interview. \"There is obviously an opportunity to standardize a number of things that could be to the benefit of the overall industry.\" Rethinking cars and planes In the automotive sector, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler are pouring billions into autonomous technology but want the European Commission to move quickly on standards for connected vehicle communication. The car industry is also coming under increasing pressure from tougher clean air standards and the emissions goals under the Paris climate agreement that are boosting sales of electric vehicles. Similar forces are remaking the shipping and trucking sectors. The Commission is playing a key role in those areas. The European Parliament and the Council are moving toward emissions standards that make the car industry blanch \u2014 but the Dieselgate scandal and Germany's weakened government have been unable to halt the steamroller of regulation. Business models are also shifting thanks to external competition, creating growing pressure to build European champions in the model of Airbus. Early examples are the recent deal allowing\u00a0Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to take control of France\u2019s STX shipyard, and the nascent merger of Germany's Siemens and France's Alstom to create a rail company large enough to compete with China's\u00a0CRRC. Those mergers are forcing the Commission's competition arm to get involved, setting off a collision between textbook adherence to free market rules and pressure from national capitals to protect key industries and technologies. That's what's happening now with Siemens-Alstom, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron grumble about the possibility that Brussels will derail a merger they see as a vital interest. The Commission is under similar pressure when it comes to aviation. The Continent's airspace is reaching capacity. It's increasingly difficult to build new airports or expand old ones \u2014 Heathrow's and Vienna's third runway, the boondoggle of Berlin's new airport, and the scrapped scheme to build a new airport in Nantes, France, all testify to those difficulties. One way to make air travel function better is to better integrate air traffic control. However, a\u00a0crucial update to the Single European Sky, the EU's air traffic management system, has been stuck in the Council for years owing to a diplomatic spat between Spain and the U.K. over Gibraltar airport \u2014 a roadblock that may be lifted thanks to Brexit. Alternative air traffic management systems like Free Route Airspace and PBN-IR haven't been made mainstream either. \u201cI ... call on the European Commission to provide guidance,\" said Athar Khan, the secretary-general of aviation lobby group EBAA at an event last week. Regulators and politicians traditionally are a step or two behind the business and the technology transforming these industries. That's the case in shipping, where Commission efforts to create seamless and paperless customs declarations have been brought in much more slowly than industry demands. The same applies to drones. Only this summer the EU agreed to hand regulatory control to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). At a European Parliament event in June, EASA chief Patrick Ky said the agency is yet to determine many of the safety regulations it will impose. Politics intrudes The political calendar is likely to make that problem even worse. Next year's European election and the selection of a new European Commission is going to mean personnel and priority changes that industry worries it can't afford. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit worried that the people who are driving [drones] may not be around,\u201d said Christoph Raab, the head of lobby group Drone Alliance Europe. It's a vexing challenge. How does the Commission regulate an industry just taking off? Does it make sense for Brussels or national governments to try to choose winners and invest in new technology that may or may not pay off? How do regulators figure out safety issues thrown up by new technology \u2014 the philosophical dimension of self-driving cars show the tangle that results. How can all of this be done while ensuring privacy? Brussels certainly feels the pressure to act. China is way ahead when it comes to developing electric vehicles and the batteries that power them \u2014 dominating world production alongside South Korea and Japan. Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the\u00a0Commission vice president in charge of the energy union and a contender to become the next Commission president, has made the development of a European battery cell production industry a personal pet project. That initiative turns one year old this week, and so far progress has been minimal. Without a regulatory framework, the blending of new and old methods of transport with revolutionary technology will be slowed \u2014 something Europe can't afford as it competes with China and the U.S. A century ago, technology upended old ways of travel. Regulators had to work out rules for cars, trucks, airplanes and ships \u2014 and revamp cities and infrastructure built for horses and sail to match. They face a similar challenge now. *** Britain's push into autonomous driving hits a roadblock \u2014 By Mark Scott MILTON KEYNES, England \u2014 The well-manicured roads of this commuter town an hour north of London are center stage for Britain's grand experiment in driverless cars. The big idea? To make the country a global leader thanks to industry-friendly policies and a flexible approach to regulation. On a recent sunny afternoon, the government's hopes were in full view on Milton Keynes' roads as autonomous cars built by Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Motors and other companies weaved through light traffic, guided only by onboard technology. Their presence here is the result\u00a0of a three-year,\u00a0\u00a318 million government-backed project aimed at enticing some of the world's largest carmakers to start building next-generation vehicles in automaking centers like Milton Keynes and nearby Coventry. But Britain faces plenty of competition on the road to a driverless future. From Germany and Finland to\u00a0the United States and China, nations are also rolling out the carpet for carmakers and tech companies in the global race to build autonomous vehicles. Adding to the U.K.'s challenge is Brexit. Uncertainty surrounding Britain's departure from the European Union \u2014 and what it means for global manufacturers with significant investments here \u2014 is no vote in its favor, according to car executives and industry experts. \"Britain wants to promote itself as the country to test and develop connected and autonomous vehicles,\" said Tim Armitage,\u00a0associate director at the engineering consulting firm Arup, which oversaw the U.K.-based project.\u00a0\"Brexit will be a problem. The uncertainty around it will be clearly damaging.\" Central to industry concerns is whether manufacturers will continue to enjoy unfettered access to EU markets, where their extensive supply chains feed parts back to British factories. In addition to building cars locally, many global automakers also have invested tens of millions of pounds into research and development sites, including some focused on autonomous driving. \"We, and our partners in the supply chain, face an unpredictable future if the Brexit negotiations do not maintain free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market,\" Ralf Speth, head of Jaguar Land Rover, told U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May at an industry summit last month.\u00a0\u201cWe urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the U.K.\"  What happens next?\n Back in 2014, when the former coalition government set aside tens of millions of pounds to jumpstart autonomous driving programs, nobody saw the Brexit vote coming. The initiative ranged from large-scale autonomous driving projects with blue-chip automakers like Jaguar Land Rover to efforts geared at helping the country's smaller car players and startups. These fledging companies ran experiments with everything from autonomous buses to driverless pods, which would shuttle passengers along sidewalks next to pedestrians at less than 10 kilometers per hour. \"We now employ 64 people in Coventry,\"\u00a0Miles Garner,\u00a0sales and marketing director at RDM Group , a small British carmaker behind the slow-moving pod, which trundled around Milton Keynes as part of the autonomous show. \"The project has come a long way in the last three years.\" In total, the U.K. government has earmarked more than a \u00a3100 million to promote connected and autonomous car projects. Manufacturers have also taken advantage of a relatively lax regulatory regime to test-drive next generation technology. In other countries, notably France, Germany and the United States, strict rules often make it difficult to test vehicles in real-world environments. \"The U.K., compared to other countries, is a very open testing environment,\" said Eliot Dixon, an autonomous driving engineer at Tata Motors, speaking from the back seat of one of the Indian automakers' autonomous 4x4s as it whistled around a roundabout in Milton Keynes. \"The laws are very pragmatic when it comes to testing our vehicles.\" London is on a mission to seduce firms like Tata, the parent company of Jaguar Land Rover. The company has established a research center on the outskirts of Coventry, and expects to use its U.K.-based team to help develop driverless vehicle technology that will then be shipped back to India for use in commercial vehicles.  Post-Brexit world\n After years of providing financial incentives to carmakers, the U.K. government now wants to shift its focus toward supporting new technology for public transportation in cities. That pivot could prove daunting. Brian Matthews, head of transport innovation at Milton Keynes Council, said that while his local government colleagues had seized upon the new funding, mostly because of the city's existing automotive industry, other parts of the country have shown little interest in becoming test grounds for the latest technology. Other local governments, he noted, were focused squarely on the daily budget concerns amid ongoing austerity, and did not believe they could spend public funds on autonomous trials\u00a0\u2014 deemed more a luxury than a necessity. Matthews said he had invited more than 85 local authorities to the recent showcase of the city's driverless and connected car projects to show them what was possible even under tough budgetary conditions. Despite repeated efforts,\u00a0only two agreed to show up. \"Local government is under so much pressure, we can't be seen to be doing this if we don't have resources for basic needs,\" Matthews said. \"But there is a business case for getting involved. We now know the technology works.\" ** Belgium\u2019s local divisions snarl mobility policy \u2014 By Hanne Cokelaere Trust Belgium to turn local election traffic issues into a constitutional conundrum. Belgium held local elections on Sunday, and hundreds of candidates stood in the 19 communes that make up Brussels. Traffic issues were a big part of their campaigns. But if the Brussels regional government \u2014 one of the country\u2019s three federal regions along with Wallonia and Flanders \u2014\u00a0has its way, none of the people elected should have much to say in transport policy. For Bianca Debaets, state secretary responsible for traffic safety for the Brussels region, the abundance of local officials is a source of frustration. \u201cIf we were to transfer the competences for public works and traffic safety entirely to the region \u2026 we\u2019d be able to plan better across the municipalities\u2019 borders,\u201d said Debaets, who was also\u00a0a candidate on the list of the Christian Democrats for Brussels center. When it comes to mobility policy, Brussels\u2019 regional authority is in the driver\u2019s seat, drawing up policies and controlling the bigger regional roads that criss-cross the capital. But the communes are in charge of their own set of local roads. \u201cIt happens all too often that a bike lane ends where the municipality ends,\u201d Debaets said. The commune\u2019s mayors are also in charge the capital\u2019s police zones, giving them a say in the enforcement of traffic rules. The overlapping jurisdictions can create gridlock. The city\u2019s Leopold II tunnel crosses four municipalities. When the region last year wanted to implement a system to enforce the tunnel\u2019s 50 kilometers-per-hour speed limit, it had to get the green light from four different commune mayors to fine speeders. \u201cAfter long debates and negotiations, three out of four were convinced. But the fourth refused point-blank, and then that was that,\u201d Debaets said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be possible. I do respect local competences and autonomy but the fact that some pay so little attention to traffic safety is unacceptable,\u201d she said. Pascal Smet wants to go one step further. The Brussels region minister for public works argues the communes should be absorbed entirely into the region. \u201cWith 19 municipalities and a region \u2026 there\u2019s always someone who can put a spanner in the works,\u201d said Mathias Dobbels, a spokesman for the minister. \u201cTraffic safety suffers under the surplus of governance levels. There are too many people who can delay or thwart plans.\u201d  Pointing fingers\n Unsurprisingly, local politicians see the problems as being caused higher up the political food chain. \u201cSome politicians, because they haven\u2019t accomplished anything, open fire in every direction \u2014 that\u2019s a sickness in Belgium,\u201d said Els Ampe, alderman for public works and mobility for Brussels center and a candidate for the Liberals. She accuses\u00a0the regional government of using local administrations as a scapegoat for infrastructure delays. \u201cWhenever an alderman or mayor voices his opinion, he gets accused of frustrating the plans.\u201d She blames the regional government for Brussels\u2019 notorious traffic congestion and poor safety record. \u201cAs long as nothing happens \u2014 and nothing\u2019s happened over the past 15 years \u2014 we\u2019ll be running in circles,\u201d she said. \u201cThe argument that things would be better if the regional authorities were in charge, c\u2019est de la carabistouille \u2014 it\u2019s a joke,\u201d said Bernard Clerfayt, long-time mayor of the Schaerbeek commune. He calls the regional government \u201cthe sick man of Brussels.\u201d \u201cThe idiotic argument that the communes are pursuing policies against the region is false,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the region trying to justify its incapacity.\u201d That squabbling infuriates local activists like\u00a0Pieter Fannes, founder of a movement called 1030/0 \u2014 which aims to reduce traffic deaths to zero. He started the local initiative in 2017, after a young woman was killed on one of the riskiest roads in Schaerbeek. \u201cIt is no coincidence that [accidents] happen time and time again on those same traffic nodes,\u201d Fannes said. \u201cThe system does not work well \u2026 But whatever you do, solve it. It\u2019s human lives you\u2019re playing with. This problem is too important to have to depend on political games.\u201d And the fight within Brussels is only a small part of the usual frictions within Belgium. To work properly, Brussels should also coordinate more closely with the surrounding Flemish and Walloon communes, said Geert te Boveldt, a research associate at the MOBI mobility research center. Mobility is a key example of an area that doesn\u2019t obey Belgium\u2019s linguistic and political divisions, but attempts to shift powers away from the local level are often treated as a threat to Belgium\u2019s language communities, Te Boveldt said. \u201cThe Belgian state structure was construed to keep the peace between [Dutch-speaking and French-speaking] communities, and it works pretty well in that respect. But it pans out very badly in other policy fields,\u201d he said."}

The first is the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, set up by the European Commission. The second is the Global Tech Panel, set up by EU diplomatic service, the European External Action Service (EEAS). Both groups had their first meetings in June. But while the goal of the first is to produce public reports, the second group operates behind closed doors. Andrea Renda, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies think tank in Brussels, is one of the 52 members of the high-level expert group. He told EUobserver that the experience has been \"mixed\" so far. While he praised the expertise and variety of the members, the size also made things complicated. The high-level group met three times so far, in June, September, and October. It decided that AI is such an enormous subject, that it had to divide into two groups \u2013 only to realise that even further subdivisions were needed, into a total of 14 working groups. \"This doesn't necessarily guarantee that we reach a very homogeneous result in the end,\" admitted Renda. Renda's group has been tasked to produce draft ethical guidelines for developing AI, as well as recommendations for whether to adapt or introduce new legislation, and investment recommendations. He said that following political pressure from commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the deadline for the guidelines has been tightened. It is expected by December. \"I wish we had been given more time. But since this is the time we have, however acrobatically, we will try to do the best we can,\" he said.  Frankenstein problem\n The academic warned of a potential \"Frankenstein problem\" - trying to merge the results of the 14 working groups into a single document when there may be internal contradictions. \"We might end up with the urge to assemble a patchwork of relatively alien contributions that will have to work together,\" he said. With so many outspoken experts involved, Renda cited another risk. \"The worst that can happen is that the report comes out and some of the members say: 'I disassociate myself from the report because that's not what I meant and I disagree with some of these things.' It's going to be complicated.\" It gets more complicated when you consider that that other group, the Global Tech Panel, set up by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, also has artificial intelligence on its radar. The four 'work streams' of the panel may relate to AI in one form or another: lethal autonomous weapons; digital skills; ethics of applied machine learning in surveillance, justice and security; cyber security. One of the Global Tech Panel members, Tom Fletcher, said he hoped the panel would \"come up with some very practical proposals on what we do about artificial intelligence, the sort of ethics and rules and governance of the internet\". That means that both groups are working in some way or another on the ethics of AI. Fletcher, a former UK ambassador to Lebanon and now visiting professor at New York University Abu Dhabi, said he has not interacted with the high-level expert group on AI. \"I assume within the EU system people are swapping notes and are in touch, but I'm not really aware of that group to be honest,\" he said. Renda said that the two groups should meet. \"I think it would be a good idea to establish some ... coherence between the work of the two groups, some interaction,\" he noted, adding that he was not aware of any such plans. A spokeswoman for the EEAS told EUobserver in a written comment, however, that the panel \"does not aim to produce policy papers or otherwise contribute directly to the preparation or implementation of EU legislation, legislative proposals, policy initiatives or other delegated acts\". However, that contradicts an earlier statement from , which said that the panel was \"set to feed into the EU Strategy on Artificial Intelligence the European Commission will put forward in November\"."}

Hanane Taidi is Director General of the International Federation of Inspection Agencies (IFIA). IFIA represents around 60 of the world\u2019s leading international testing, inspection and certification bodies representing over 300,000 employees. Drewin Nieuwenhuis is the Secretary General of CEOC, the International Confederation of Inspection and Certification Organisations. CEOC is the European sister organisation of IFIA, representing 29 organisations from 19 countries, employing over 111,000 people. Rapid digitalisation has personalised cybersecurity. It is no longer only critical infrastructure or business data that is under threat, personal data and safety in general are also at stake. While the need to protect critical infrastructure remains vital, cybersecurity has become intrinsically linked to everything we do. Whether using fitness or dating apps, controlling home temperatures from mobile devices, banking or shopping online, or using connected and autonomous cars \u2013 cyber-attacks can and will increasingly impact our daily lives. In this context, the European Commission\u2019s proposal for a Cybersecurity Act is a fundamental step in the right direction. The proposal for common EU-wide cybersecurity certification for products and services will raise the level of trust and security within the connected society. Governments and citizens must be able to trust in the security of their critical infrastructure, systems, components and devices, while businesses need clarity on security requirements and certification for products. As it stands, there is a broad set of fragmented security certification schemes that already exist or are being proposed across Europe and around the world and in some cases there is an absence of standards. The varying degrees of certification requirements, coupled with differing standards, can be costly and difficult to navigate, limiting industry\u2019s ability to meet the highest standards for cybersecurity. Creating a common certification framework recognised across all Member States, will not only create greater efficiencies but will encourage investment in higher levels of security and enable consumers to confidently choose the right level of cybersecurity. Business will benefit too. For a single product to access multiple markets today, a company may need to undergo several certification procedures across the Member States. Creating a one-stop-shop certification framework will make it easier for businesses to trade across borders by reducing the resources required to test and certify for security measures, this would also enable industry to divert greater resources into investment in security research and development. A harmonised approach to testing and certification will build consumer confidence in the security of the products they purchase and help them understand the security features of the product or service. This in turn will make the cybersecurity certification more attractive for businesses as an effective means to communicate the level of cybersecurity assurance of ICT products or services to their customers. Getting the Cybersecurity Act right is vital. However the devil is in the details with regard to ensuring it is effective, and truly contributes to cybersecurity. The European Commission\u2019s proposed certification framework is voluntary, and includes varying degrees of assurance (basic, substantial and high) for certifying ICT products and services. Currently, the European Parliament is discussing whether certification should be mandatory for the \u201chigh assurance\u201d level and whether self-assessment by the manufacturer should be introduced. Both will have their advantages and disadvantages if not designed properly, but what remains central is that connected products must come with a strong guarantee that they are safe and meet necessary minimum-security requirements. Certification and independent third party conformity assessment can protect against attacks and ensure the highest level of cybersecurity and trust. Independent third party conformity should be the basis for the substantial- and high-assurance levels, where the consequences of cyber-attacks are the greatest. It serves as a highly regulated yet cost-effective solution, providing the highest level of confidence while helping government and business \u2013 particularly small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) \u2013 save resources. While major multinationals may be able to carry out rigorous conformity assessment, many SMEs simply do not have the resources to do so. Many products found in the European marketplace today are the result of complex supply chains stretched across the globe and manufactured by both European and non-European companies. As cybersecurity levels cannot be tested and checked by the end user or the consumer, reliance on third party certification combined with strong market surveillance for those products not covered by certification empowers the consumer to have confidence in the security of their products and services. The risk potential of the ICT product and service needs to be taken into account when determining the applicable assurance level (basic, substantial, high) and conformity assessment procedure. The higher the risk, the higher the required assurance level, and the more strict and comprehensive the conformity assessment procedure should be. Furthermore, manufacturers who produce connected products may not always be aware of the changing risks associated with connecting a product, updating software, or the rapidly changing cybersecurity landscape. This should be taken into account when carrying out risk assessment. While some stakeholders may be calling for products and services with low assurance level to be subject only to self-assessment it is important to a) classify what type of products and services are covered and b) ensure that self-assessment is subject to the same rigorous vetting process as independent third-party conformity assessment bodies As the discussions in the European Parliament on the Cybersecurity Act approach a critical point, it is imperative that MEPs get behind the Commission\u2019s proposal and focus on the fact that in the digitalised world, there is no safety without security. Strong certification and independent third party conformity assessment that protects consumers, while providing business with a one-stop-shop solution, will be key in creating a digital single market for cybersecurity and digital products in general."}

He spoke to EURACTIV\u2019s Alexandra Brzozowski on the sidelines of the European Business Summit in Brussels.  How could digital economy improve business and public-sector performance?\n How could digital economy improve business and public-sector performance? Digital is not one single technology, digital is a range of technologies. It has empowered the ultimate end user, for example, individuals like me, you, or the businesses if it\u2019s a business to business communication or cooperation. It has empowered them in the sense that you could make the whole dialogue of a particular transaction that you\u2019re trying to do with anybody being more interactive, more instantaneous, more intuitive. I think that\u2019s the power of digital. So, it is the responsibility of the organizations, I need to be cognicent of that. And then make sure that they provide. Because ultimately you see, hey, that organization is doing it, that ministry is doing it, why we not doing it?  You are basically speaking about Big Data. Companies started gathering more and more data, and as we slowly acknowledge, computers can also predict behaviours. How is big data analysis helpful to increase the revenue of businesses, for example? \n You are basically speaking about Big Data. Companies started gathering more and more data, and as we slowly acknowledge, computers can also predict behaviours. How is big data analysis helpful to increase the revenue of businesses, for example? That is an excellent point. If you really look at what organizations have done for the last seven years, they were focusing on processes. The process maturity was the key to them, but the future is all about data maturity, because there is so much data coming into the system and data is no longer a structure data. A lot of unstructured data comes in. Big Data is a technology that essentially helps to mash your structured data, unstructured data and then see patterns around it, and then see how it can help to mitigate some of this, how to make sense of all of this. And the quantum of data that is coming into your access increases every second. That is the reality today. So Big Data is a big enabler. Big Data combined with Artificial Intelligence is the next wave, that is what is going to make a huge difference to us.  Where exactly are the challenges and opportunities of AI?\n Where exactly are the challenges and opportunities of AI? I think there is a big debate about artificial intelligence today. One question is: What does Artificial Intelligence mean and where it can impact? That is one big debate. The second thing is about: Is Artificial Intelligence going to take away jobs? Is it going to improve productivity tremendously? And then the third is: Is it only applicable for defence and surveillance and security complaints etc. or can we apply it for day to day business? So, the answer is, in my opinion, AI is not going to take away jobs. It is going to \u2013 like any change in technology, whether it is from Industry 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 \u2013 every time it is a radical shift in technology that happened, it has improved the productivity of people, it has improved the quality of life of people. Likewise, Artificial Intelligence, in my opinion, will improve the quality of life, improve readily accessible information. Because of Artificial Intelligence, you are in a position to scale your business much better, you will be able to take right decisions, you will be able to give them a better experience with the customers. You will become much more relevant to the customers; the customer\u2019s loyalty will be with you. So they will pump in more transactions and volume will grow.  Your technology services firm has reinvented how to deliver services as I understood. Should business then embrace automation?\n Your technology services firm has reinvented how to deliver services as I understood. Should business then embrace automation? Absolutely. I think, in every business, whether it is the IT services business or a bank or a manufacturing company, disruption is very, very important. And I think, you know, if you are not going to disrupt yourself, somebody else going to disrupt you. Business 4.0 is all about continuous disruption as opposed to continuous improvement. Continuous disruption is the norm.  In fact, it could change the whole working environment.\n In fact, it could change the whole working environment. Absolutely. Europe is actually very much ahead of the rest of the world. Every bank that I have seen in here, or every transport company that I have seen here or retail company, they have been going through a large-scale workplace and workforce transformation, they are changing their offices to be a lot more collaborative, corner offices are vanishing, conference rooms are no longer there. What places workforce transformation? They also train their people, upskilling their people to the new ways of working, knowing these new technologies. How can you integrate with the machine learning libraries and how can you develop algorithms? Yes, you can automate some of this, but then how can you put all these things together and generate an algorithm on top of it, so that it doesn\u2019t happen again? So, automation is the key thing and I think, I wholeheartedly feel that people have to embrace that.  When it comes to cybersecurity, what are the approaches that we would need to help enterprises to detect, respond, and also recover from cyber threats?\n When it comes to cybersecurity, what are the approaches that we would need to help enterprises to detect, respond, and also recover from cyber threats? Very good question. Unfortunately, for cybersecurity there are no silver bullets right now. Each organisation has to do its part and I think the key thing is to collaborate and share best practices, because it is quickly evolving and because it is done by people who will always want to be one step ahead of you and we want to be one step ahead of them. So, it is a race that\u2019s going on, right? In that sense organizations need to come together. There has to be a unified way of doing it and a collaborative way of sharing information, that is a very important point. The second point is: research has to happen. A lot more research has to happen. And we as TCS, we are working with some of the universities in the US as well in Australia and in Europe to see whether we can find a silver bullet for doing this. But at the same time, it is a lot more about awareness, for example, what information you want to put into Facebook, what information do you want to put on LinkedIn? And we have to work with Social Media companies to make sure that they are able to protect my privacy information, a lot more than what they are doing today.  Are we Europeans, getting too anxious about sharing our data? We have the GDPR regulation which comes into force today, for example, and after the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal, people are getting very anxious. \n Are we Europeans, getting too anxious about sharing our data? We have the GDPR regulation which comes into force today, for example, and after the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal, people are getting very anxious. Rightfully so. You are anxious, and we are all anxious. But I think, there is a tradition in Europe that privacy is important and somehow you know, the others are not recognizing that. For example, in developing countries like India or China or the Asian countries, they have not understood yet the implications of it. They work very hard to guarantee their basic living, for them, you know, that is more important than the privacy of information. Whereas here, quality of life is deeply important, your personal time is important, your personal information is very important. One of the things that we look at from India or China or any of these countries is that Europe has led the world in terms of standards, in terms of policies. And I don\u2019t think any other country put the amount of effort and investments have made in defining policies and standards and procedures. For example, data privacy, GDPR, who has done it? Only Europe. People are discussing data privacy, but now they are looking at GDPR and saying: How can we adopt this? Europe they are implementing lot more workplace workforce transformation, they have invested a lot more on digital foundation, or digital core as we call it. Yesterday it was very nice to see people talking about one digital Europe. What does it really mean? Are we there? Are we not there?  Speaking of disruptions, there are\u00a0obviously disruptions from all sides, which we can see looking at the EU-US relations for example. Do you think that we might be doomed to a global trade war, because of President Trump\u2019s protectionist instincts which also could have a hampering impact on business and how we deal with new innovations in certain fields?\n Speaking of disruptions, there are\u00a0obviously disruptions from all sides, which we can see looking at the EU-US relations for example. Do you think that we might be doomed to a global trade war, because of President Trump\u2019s protectionist instincts which also could have a hampering impact on business and how we deal with new innovations in certain fields? I am not an economist, I cannot comment on this too much but the way that I see it is that it is unusual. No other US administration in the past\u00a0has taken such steps. So, in that sense, it\u2019s unusual. And so we are feeling, oh my God, what is it happening? But if you look at it from the perspective of trade, that is a trade negotiation that takes place in every country, in Europe-Vietnam, Europe-ASEAN, Europe-India, Europe-China. It is business as usual.  But would you say that the business environment is going to be negatively affected by that? \n But would you say that the business environment is going to be negatively affected by that? Well, in the short-term it will be. But I think\u00a0the US and Europe collaboration and the partnership is so deeply engrained, I think it will set itself right. Again, that is the optimist in me speaking. Business has to proceed, and you know, people are using Apple computers, they are buying cars, they are buying Airbus planes and Boeing planes. And they\u2019re not going to stop right there."}

He said the next EU budget should focus on helping home-grown European companies use the continent\u2019s research in areas like artificial intelligence to compete on a global scale . Looking at the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament term winding down next year, how does that in political terms affect EIT Digital? What are your priorities now? If you look at the Commission\u2019s innovation research programme and Horizon Europe you see that for EIT Digital the situation looks very good. First of all, for EIT, there\u2019s a growing budget, there\u2019s much more emphasis on innovation. And we see outside Horizon Europe an additional \u20ac 9 billion for digital, in particular around artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. All in all, I think compared to previously, digital is much more exposed in the plans of the Commission, so that\u2019s very good news. Although I still think that the impact of digital is not always very well understood. We\u2019re making enormous progress, in the popular press digital topics are quite prominent. Nowadays privacy, Facebook-Cambridge Analytica, and cybersecurity are of course much bigger topics. And digital finance and digital currencies, bitcoin and the underlying technologies like blockchain, have a lot of mystery around them. Driverless cars, AI, you see that the digital topic is really all over the place. Nevertheless, if you look at investments in Europe and compare it to the US, we still have a bit to go. We\u2019re working on the digital single market, and that should go much, much faster. If you see the time it took to have roaming charges off the table, I think by that time everybody was using Wifi and WhatsApp. No one was using normal calls anymore anyway. Do you see EIT\u2019s focus on specific technologies shifting now or in the coming years? The big topics are the digitisation of our industry, cybersecurity is always a hot topic. Digital finance is an emerging area. Digital currencies have a lot of promise but on the other hand, nobody wants to use them only overnight so you have digital currency fluctuation. You see those areas becoming very prominent. The other area is the maker industry and Europe will have to reinforce that. You see protectionism going on, you see society being torn between the workers that see threats in technology and the part of society that only sees opportunities in a lot of technologies. Such a divide leads to an unstable government. The Brexit discussion is a sign of that, the American presidency is a sign of that. We see instability rising and our governments will have to find an answer to that. Social cohesion is really important for economic wealth, they reinforce each other. Those are the topics that are ahead of us and for us as EIT Digital, we contribute to the digitisation of industry big time. Robots are not a threat but an opportunity. That has to do with education, with awareness creation, that also has to do with building the factual picture rather than just spreading fear. We are acting in those areas. I see cybersecurity expanding, I see digitisation of the industry expanding. Our education system is under pressure. In the Netherlands, universities don\u2019t have the capacity to have enough AI students. Our education system needs to be more flexible, more open and also itself use digital technologies to be able to quickly scale courses in case there is a growing demand. Public outrage has increased in recent years over how certain technologies affect privacy or how automation could potentially replace human jobs. Should politicians address this anger directed at technology companies? Technology can be used in a constructive way but it can also be used in a destructive way. The feeling I have is that the current discussion misses the ethics element in the development, and it misses the technical discussion when it comes to the argument you see being made in public. Because it\u2019s a lot about opinion, it\u2019s a lot about prediction, it\u2019s a lot about speculation and it\u2019s little about facts. That being said, every technological revolution or transformation has met resistance. As such, that is not new, resistance has to be taken seriously because in the end technology has to land in the society and society has to accept and embrace technology. Otherwise technology will be a divider, but it can also be a uniter. I see those fears, I see those arguments, I think some of them are right. The dominance of single parties in certain markets is by definition not good, whether it\u2019s a technical domain or any other domain. As long as there is no serious competitor to Facebook, the situation is not good. But that\u2019s a general principle that would be the same if it had to do with a municipal oil company or a single hospital or what have you. It doesn\u2019t have much to do with technology. It has to do in this case with the fact that the digital world develops very fast. Legislation has difficulties to catch up, understanding it is also difficult because: can you translate physical world rules to the digital world? We\u2019re still struggling with that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re now in a situation where things are turbulent because they go very fast, people are sometimes taken by surprise and don\u2019t understand the consequences. There shouldn\u2019t be a dominance of single players. That\u2019s something that has to be addressed maybe by breaking up companies. The focus is too much on technology regulation and trying to stop companies from technological development. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to do this. Is it EIT Digital\u2019s role to help support competition in Europe and develop competitors to these American tech giants like Facebook? If you look at our budget, it would be a little bit too optimistic to think that we can immediately compete with them. What we can do is plant the seeds that can grow to a more serious presence of European companies in the digital world. That\u2019s what\u2019s currently lacking. The way we do that is we attract talent to Europe, we are seeking this talent not only with technical skills but also with entrepreneurship skills. We help them to flourish in an ecosystem where we stimulate them to be entrepreneurial within existing companies or to create their own companies where we help them to scale. There are certain periods in their lives where they need some help. And one of the periods is the scaling phase. Starting a company in Europe is not that difficult, you can raise your first investment money from angels, friends, family. However, when you need \u20ac 5 or \u20ac50 million, there\u2019s a kind of gap. If you\u2019re only on the radar of the big investors, you can get upwards of \u20ac 50 million upwards because you more or less have proven yourself as an interesting investment. But with a bit of hand-holding some can be led to bridge that gap. Europe is lagging behind in technology investment compared to the US and China. Does Europe need a more comprehensive program like China\u2019s \u2018China 2025\u2019 to really help the tech industry? You have programs at the European level from the European Commission and if you look at the numbers for the total European budget compared to the national budget of different countries, then you see that that is where the action is. What you can do at the European level is facilitate and mostly work on policy that is implemented on national level afterwards, like the digital single market. But most of the work needs to come from individual countries. A good alignment between countries, like Germany and France, are working on when it comes to the technological agenda, that helps. I don\u2019t think that Europe has the political structure to have these kinds of China 2025 programmes because our governance, the way we work, the autonomy of national governments is completely different than in China. Europe should do two things: speed up the digital single market because the 500 million people are really economically powerful instruments on this market. And on the other hand, technology development is something that is much more local, it happens in certain regions and sometimes in certain cities around specific industry clusters with a specific focus. That\u2019s what the national agenda should focus on. We need a hybrid approach where the policy alignment is really a focus of Brussels and the smart specialisation is much more on a national and regional level with very specific industry investments where you want to excel. In the Commission\u2019s MFF proposal, funding will go towards a few focus areas like AI and cybersecurity. Will that set the tech policy agenda Europe needs? Definitely, the area is well chosen. Within AI, there is still a variety of topics you can address. That\u2019s great. On the other hand, \u20ac 9 billion for that package seems like a lot of money but if you\u2019re going to distribute it over 7 years over 27 member states then it\u2019s probably what Google is spending on the same topic in one month. You have to be aware of what you can do on the European level. On the national level you have to reinforce that. I\u2019d say much more on specific applications. In Europe, our knowledge in universities is there. What is lacking is translating all this great AI knowledge in our research centres and universities into AI-based products from European origin that can compete in the global market. The challenge is not so much in having more AI research in Europe. Commissioner Gabriel is especially focused on digital skills. How can an EU programme promote education and digital skills when there is still a lot of brain drain of tech entrepreneurs who start in Europe and then leave? I don\u2019t think there is a huge brain drain. If I look in London, Paris, Berlin, Helsinki, Stockholm, Amsterdam, I see a lot of talented people. Some good technology from the Nordics ended up in the US, like Skype and Spotify. But I think we can keep others in Europe. It\u2019s fashionable to be an entrepreneur nowadays. If you want to sustain that and build on that you have to create interesting jobs and the right economic environment. Europe has the advantage that it\u2019s a nice continent to live on, people are in general very happy here, there\u2019s good infrastructure, there\u2019s good medical care, there\u2019s a good social security system. But we have to create the jobs and the economic growth to keep those talents here. We should be a little bit more proud of this. Silicon Valley is great. I\u2019m in Silicon Valley several times a year, we have a hub there. There are a lot of upsides but there are also a lot of downsides. The apartment prices are crazy, the infrastructure is overloaded. It\u2019s a monoculture, it\u2019s not very diverse, this whole valley area. There are a lot of winners. But there are 100 times more losers in the system. We know about the winners. If you\u2019ve ever been in a Google office in an outdoor workspace you\u2019re one of the 10,000 wannabe CEOs programming all day, is that really the best life? It\u2019s a balance also in Silicon Valley and I think we can offer a more balanced life in Europe."}

Poland\u2019s secretary of state for energy explains how his country is tackling the transport sector with an ambitious new plan. Micha\u0142 Kurtyka is secretary of state at Poland\u2019s Ministry of Energy. The fact that the transport sector brings many benefits to the European Union member states is incontestable. The industry employs nearly 11 million EU citizens and contributes 5% to the Union\u2019s GDP. Unfortunately, it also has a negative impact in the form of environment pollution. Transport is currently responsible for 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions, while 70% of these emissions come from road transport alone. Forecasts indicate that by 2030 transportation may become the main source of emissions in the EU. Therefore, the sector requires decisive reforms. Poland wants to pursue initiatives, together with other EU countries, aimed at balancing the mobility needs of Europe\u2019s inhabitants with protection of their health and respect for the environment. To meet the high expectations of the transport sector we have designed several regulations aimed at popularising low- and zero-emissions vehicles in Poland. The Clean Transport Package contains documents that implement a 2014 EU directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. Due to several initiatives provided for in the Package we have also decided to set up a financial instrument supporting the implementation of actions provided for in these documents. This will be the Low-emission Transport Fund (FNT). Support from the Fund will be provided both to electromobility growth initiatives and to alternative fuel based transport projects such as hydrogen, CNG and LNG. The range of projects eligible for financing is very broad \u2013 support will be provided to among others means of transport manufacturers, local governments investing in clean public transport, bio-component producers, as well as entities planning new vehicle purchases. The Fund is also to support promotion and education on the use of alternative fuels in transport. For this the FNT will have a budget of around PLN 6.7 billion until 2027. The measures proposed by Poland, intended to finance electromobility development and alternative fuel based transport projects, complement EU initiatives in this area. The EU Clean Mobility Package indicates that in the coming years the key will be the improvement of transport organisation (particularly improving the effectiveness and integration of various types of transport), popularisation of cleaner vehicles (by enacting new CO2\u00a0emissions limits for vehicles), as well as increasing the availability of alternative energy to the transport industry, among others by building the relevant infrastructure. The Low-emission Transport Fund will be responsible for implementation of these assumptions at national level. The Urban Agenda for the EU indicates that urbanised areas inhabited by the majority of EU citizens are the flywheels of Union\u2019s economy. We are eager for Polish cities to benefit from the innovative and collaboration-based approach to development and deployment of locally-oriented strategies while keeping a significant European dimension. I am convinced that with the establishment of the Low-emission Transport Fund, local governments, undertakings and NGOs will become equal partners in the initiative. The FNT goals are identical to those of the Urban Agenda for the EU, being primarily the improvement of the quality of life of citizens and overcoming the key challenges faced by cities \u2013 from employment up to mobility, environment and climate change. Moreover, success of urban development will be the key element of the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d strategy for smart sustainable economic growth. Today, electromobility expresses the Union\u2019s aspirations for creating business and technology solutions in the EU that may provide it with a competitive advantage. Poland very much welcomes the fact that these aspirations are focused on a technology challenge. Achieving the agreed electromobility targets will require an innovative, sustainable and competitive battery value chain throughout Europe. Batteries play a key role in the industrial revolution around us. European universities and businesses are aspiring to become an important part of this emerging chain. This is why Poland has very enthusiastically joined the Commission\u2019s EU Battery Alliance intended to develop a competitive value chain and also production of batteries in Europe. Expanding electromobility in Poland and in the EU alike requires further legislative measures and consistently closer international economic cooperation between the member states . National universities are conducting extensive research on energy conversion and applied electrochemistry . Importantly \u2013 Poland also has raw material resources needed for battery manufacturing and Polish entrepreneurs have the potential to engage in growing this sector. Funds coming from the Low-emission Transport Fund will be the final complementary element, allowing financing of domestic initiatives under the EU Battery Alliance. Combining international collaboration, government support and scientific potential and industry will allow Poland to become a key element of the European battery supply chain in a few years, and will allow the EU to develop modern technology innovations to compete with solutions coming from other parts of the world. Another important aspect to be affected by initiatives deployed with the Low-emission Transport Fund financing is reduction of road transport induced pollution. Support for growth of electromobility and popularisation of alternative fuels opens up realistic perspectives for air quality improvements not only in Poland but also in all EU countries. It is worth noting that air quality improvement will not only improve public health (lower healthcare costs) but will also reduce damage to the environment and to buildings. It will also contribute towards reduction of traffic noise. The measures relating to deployment of electromobility and popularisation of alternative fuels-based transport in Poland complement the relevant initiatives of the European Union. As the Community, we are creating a legislative space and conditions for development of a new innovative and competitive market in the EU. However, the shape of the European model of popularisation of electromobility will mostly be influenced by entrepreneurs, scientists and vehicle and public transport users. So the job of the member states is to establish the optimal support instruments aimed at stimulating the uptake of electromobility and alternative fuels in their countries."}

Though these cities mean well, such restrictions are burdensome and come at a cost for motorists, so smart mobility measures need to be proposed instead, writes Laurianna Krid. Laurianne Krid is the director general of the Federation Internationale de l\u2019Automobile Region. Across Europe, cities are beginning to put in place restrictions on cars accessing urban areas. Here,\u00a0of course, we are talking about diesel vehicle bans, congestion charges and car restricted zones. Although perhaps well-intentioned, these initiatives are highly burdensome and costly for motorists, both for residents and visitors alike. Decision-makers need to start thinking outside the box and begin to deliver smart mobility solutions for road users. Most car owners bought their vehicles in good faith, trusting the emissions levels advertised. These same people have to pay additional environmental charges or lose the right to drive in the city. Furthermore, these restrictions could affect the resale value of their cars, which could be a significant financial hit as a personal car is often the second biggest expenditure most consumers will make during their lives.  Better information for consumers\n Better information for consumers Motorists now face the problem of understanding what access restrictions are in place in any given city. This is an obstacle for drivers on their daily commutes and can become a nightmare for tourists. The European Commission, cities and member states need to partner up to provide easily accessible and consistent information on the different schemes for citizens. This information should be available in multiple formats and languages to ensure that citizens clearly know when and where they can drive. Getting citizens informed is not just about providing better information about access restrictions, consumers also need to be properly informed when buying a new vehicle. Here, the European Commission needs to start the long-awaited reform of the car labelling Directive, to ensure that prospective car buyers can easily figure out which car works best for them, be it a traditionally fuelled, electric or hybrid vehicle.  Putting cleaner cars on the road\n Putting cleaner cars on the road The EU can make a significant difference by ensuring that the latest, cleanest technologies are coming on the market to reduce vehicle emissions. That\u2019s why we are calling for the EU to set more rigorous post-2020 CO2 targets for cars. The Commission has proposed a 15% reduction by 2025, but ultimately this lacks ambition. By setting more stringent targets and producing cleaner vehicles with a stricter approval process, restrictions on mobility become much less relevant.  Mobility in your pocket\n Mobility in your pocket Enhancing the interoperability and smooth functioning of different modes of transport would also offer citizens a variety of ways to get to their destination. Many cities, like London or Helsinki, are already testing a \u2018Mobility as a Service\u2019 model. This offers a variety of mobility options in a single monthly package. Subscribers would have access to public transport, share car/bike and taxi rides. In Switzerland and Spain, road users can already take advantage of integrated mobility services with the apps Simply Mobile and RACC Trips . Such services require a truly integrated network of mobility services and would be the investment with the biggest impact. Rather than penalise citizens, this empowers them. One of the major problems associated with developing apps for \u2018seamless travel\u2019 is access to ticketing and scheduling information of public transport entities. Here, the European Commission and member states must do more to open up these databases and allow innovation to flourish. This is about empowering people to use various options to fulfil their daily mobility needs. Many urban centres are implementing a one-size-fits-all approach to vehicle bans, which risks excluding many everyday users. In the search for cleaner, more streamlined mobility, a long-term view which incorporates the latest technologies and listens to citizens will have the best chance to find a lasting solution."}

And on the role copper plays in all this.  Why do cities matter?\n Why do cities matter? Cities are expanding at an unprecedented rate, with almost 80 percent of EU citizens now living in cities. However, rapid urbanisation comes with a range of sustainability challenges, from rapid resource consumption and overuse to growing waste and pollution. When it comes to climate change, cities are responsible for 70-80 percent of total EU energy consumption and for about the same share of CO2 emissions \u2013 half of it driven by buildings alone. That is a huge challenge. However, as centres of economic growth, job creation and innovation, cities can be \u2013 and are \u2013 an integral part of the solution. Over the last years, we have seen mayors stepping up as leaders in pioneering the transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future, driving change and commitment at a faster pace than national governments have been able to. With increased investment in the right infrastructure, from connected thermal and electric grids to thermal and electric storage, electric transportation to smart lights and durable water supply systems, many cities and urban areas are now well on their way to becoming more sustainable and resilient against emerging socioeconomic and environmental pressures.  What is the EU doing? \n What is the EU doing? However, the transition to greener and smarter cities will not happen overnight and requires the right legal framework in place to drive it forward, and to ensure everyone boards the sustainability train, not just the first-movers. Thankfully, cities are not alone in addressing climate, energy and environmental issues. In the last years, the European Commission has been increasing its focus on the urban agenda, with dedicated EU funding, support to city partnerships, capacity building and experience-sharing programmes, and initiatives like the European Green Capital Award and the EU Green Week. Most recently, EU legislators have been trying to tackle the issue of the environmental footprint of buildings with a revised European Performance in Buildings Directive (EPBD). It will e.g. require all new buildings to be nearly zero-emission buildings by 31 December 2020 (public buildings by end of 2018) and mandate the installation of electromobility infrastructure in new non-residential buildings and in those undergoing substantial renovation. With these new initiatives, the EU is moving in the right direction and sending a strong signal to citizens, investors and governments that the time to act is now. There is much more to be done, however, and copper is key to these efforts.  The choice of materials\n The choice of materials As a durable and sustainable metal with a long service life, copper plays a crucial role in the wiring, plumbing, heating and cooling, lighting and roofing of buildings. In fact, a recent report by the International Copper Association showed that there are more than 100 copper applications contributing to green and healthy building construction and improving the overall environmental performance of buildings. It is also a key component in many low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles, solar thermal, photovoltaics, HVAC using natural refrigerants and smart grids. As such, copper is key to improving energy efficiency, indoor air quality, water quality, and life-cycle costs. Add to that the fact that many copper-containing building products have a high proportion of recycled content, often exceeding 80%, and it is clear that copper is one of the key sustainable building materials with which we should build Europe\u2019s greener and smarter cities. Choosing the right materials and developing the right technologies will enable us to build and operate greener, more sustainable cities for the future. Not only will these solutions benefit the environment and enhance efficiency, they will also make our cities healthier, happier places to live. The copper industry is committed to being a part of this transformation, whilst also mitigating our own impact on the environment as much as possible.  ***  About ECI\n About ECI The European Copper Institute (ECI)\u2014founded in 1996 and based in Brussels\u2014coordinates a team of 38 professionals based in 10 offices across Europe, and works closely with its copper industry members on regulatory matters and market development programs.

Anna Lisa Boni is secretary general of EUROCITIES, a political platform for major European cities. Cities across Europe are committed to the transition to a greener, more sustainable and inclusive future by working with citizens and collaborating in partnerships. Urban areas are also often demonstrating more ambitious goals than their national and EU level counterparts on climate change. Through the Covenant of Mayors more than 6,000 local climate and energy action plans have been adopted across Europe, with an average CO2 reduction of around 27% expected by 2020. Cities are also following and trialling many other initiatives. Every year we now see thousands of cities engaging in the \u2018car free day\u2019, bike lanes are being privileged over more space for cars and pedestrianised city centres are becoming increasingly common place. The transition towards greener cities is happening apace across Europe. Given this, cities\u2019 role in governance procedures around energy transition must be stronger.  Local solutions\n Local solutions With more than 75% of the EU population living in urban environments, achieving the EU\u2019s environmental commitments and the Paris climate goals can only be done if cities are on board. Cities\u2019 achievements, in turn, are only possible because we involve citizens, by designing solutions with them. As the level of government closest to citizens, cities are well placed to raise awareness of sustainable consumption locally, and involve all sectors, whether civil society, entrepreneurs, businesses, financial institutions or other strands of government. Public procurement contracts can help influence the local value chain, while cities can also team up to jointly purchase new technologies, such as e-mobility solutions, thus bringing down costs and speeding up the transition. Technology can help us live more resource efficient lives, and cities provide the right scale to test out new solutions. \u2018Smart lampposts\u2019 can be fitted with censors to monitor air quality, or excess heat from server systems can be used for district heating. Such solutions and ideas are shared through networks like EUROCITIES, or the Smart Cities Information System. These ideas are then adopted or adapted by other cities, strengthening innovation and capacity building in our cities. There are many examples. Amsterdam is a pioneering city in the area of waste management, having been the first city in the world to adopt a circular economy action plan. This year the city plans to build its first nappy waste recycling facility. The city of Copenhagen has developed the first carbon neutral district and Milan has deployed the biggest bicycle sharing facilities in Europe. Stockholm\u2019s commitment to be fossil fuel free by 2040, further demonstrates cities\u2019 ambition and leadership in this area.  Cities as allies\n Cities as allies The majority of EU rules related to our environment are implemented at the local level. To really deliver on the implementation of its environment law, the EU needs to seize the initiative and direct its resources to the city level and into new areas that will help cities to innovate. The EU funded backing for the Covenant of Mayors is a great example of support for urban environmental transformation. The partners of the Urban Water Agenda 2030 want to replicate this model, to continue acknowledging the essential role of cities in this process, and should be encouraged to do so with EU support. The EU has a strong role to play in providing more support to cities for mutual learning and capacity building. To accelerate progress in the green transition and get everyone on board, it is vital that cities can continue to actively learn from each other\u2019s best practices and failures. EUROCITIES, the network of major European cities, is a very effective platform for this. The Urban Agenda for the EU is another strong initiative, bringing EU member states and the European Commission together with city representatives. We should take this momentum to upscale ideas from the local to national and European levels, and to think of new collaborations. Given that five of the 12 current partnerships of the Urban Agenda for the EU are related to the environment, the ground is already set for further developing this assistance and exploring new collaborations. As we look ahead to the next round of climate negotiations, and to implementing the SDGs, the focus of the EU Green Week reflects the growing importance and power of cities in moving us towards a more sustainable future. Cities are allies in the drive towards better quality of life for European citizens and achieving the EU\u2019s environmental ambitions."}

Developing the right platforms will be key for cities to ensure that their economies, environment, and services are fit for the future, writes Eric Woods. Eric Woods is a research director with Navigant Research. In a new report, Smart City Platforms , he examines the evolution of the global smart city platform market and provides recommendations for cities and suppliers. The idea of the smart city platform encompasses both the technical aspects of the platform concept and an emerging vision of the city as a service, enabling an innovative ecosystem of urban service providers from a diversity of industries. As such, the smart city platform is not a single product category but rather an umbrella concept for diverse offerings and bespoke city approaches. Navigant Research defines a smart city platform as\u00a0an integrated capability for coordinating data, applications, and services at one or more levels across operational domains for multiple stakeholders. We expect cities to invest more than $4 billion in smart city platforms over the next decade. However, such platforms will underpin a market for smart city services that is estimated to be worth more than $1.5 trillion.  The evolution of smart city platforms \n The evolution of smart city platforms Platforms today are closely associated with the emergence of new virtualised business models that are disrupting many traditional business domains, including retail, transportation, hospitality, and energy. Uber and Airbnb have already shown how city services can be transformed through platform offerings, but also how contentious such services can be. Many cities are striving to ensure they benefit from such innovations while maintaining appropriate control over the quality of services through new regulations and the refinement of city policy. City platforms may exist in parallel with commercial services (like Uber), integrate more closely with them, or provide an alternative model for public delivery that allows city governments to respond to citizen requirements in the digital age. For many cities, the development of their smart city platform will be an evolutionary approach, developing from initial projects for data sharing, IoT deployments, and sector-specific solutions. One of the most obvious paths for cities is to evolve their initial investments in open data platforms to provide a more comprehensive platform for collaboration and data sharing. Dubai provides an ambitious example of this approach. Dubai Pulse, created by Smart Dubai and du, the telecommunications company, is now deployed as a platform for data sharing and a range of additional services, including analytics, big data, computing, and storage services. Some cities are looking at their investment in city networks to provide the basis for their platform strategy. San Diego is one of the first cities to commit to a large-scale integrated platform for smart city deployments based on its investment in smart street lighting. The city is working with an array of private partners to deploy 3,200 intelligent nodes throughout the city that can enable air quality measuring, gunshot detection, and the tracking of traffic flow of both vehicles and pedestrians. City platforms are also emerging from development in key sectors such as transportation and energy. A good example is the urban mobility and transportation platform for Columbus, Ohio. The proposed Smart Columbus Operating System (SCOS) is a web-based, dynamic delivery platform that will collect and disseminate general mobility data (e.g., traffic, parking, weather, and construction), as well as the data generated from all the projects being developed. An example of an urban energy innovation platform is provided by London. It is developing a sustainable energy management system (SEMS) that is consolidating and analysing energy data from smart meters and other intelligent devices to optimise energy production and consumption at a community level. The SEMS links to the broader urban data platform being developed as part of the EU-funded Sharing Cities program, led by London, Milan, and Lisbon. Cross-city collaboration and sharing of idea is also important. In Europe, for example, the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities ( EIP-SCC ) is driving cross-government and industry collaboration on city platforms. Its Urban Data Platform initiative aims \u201cto speed the adoption, at scale, of common open urban data platforms and ensure that 300 million European citizens are served by cities with competent urban data platforms, by 2025.\u201d The initiative has already developed a city needs specification and published the EIP-SCC Urban Platform Management Framework.  Preparing for the emerging urban platform landscape\n Preparing for the emerging urban platform landscape In this emerging urban platform landscape, city leaders need to: Define their own priorities for how a city platform can support an evolving vision for urban development and innovation. A platform strategy needs to be shaped by this vision and should articulate core principles in terms of openness, use of standards, and alignment with other technology and business programmes. Consider overarching policies that will enable the creation of adaptable city platforms. A platform should enable a broad ecosystem that will include citizens, local businesses, and global service providers. Understand that platform development should be part of a rethinking of traditional approaches to service design, resource management, and urban planning. The potential of digital technologies needs to be considered as part of any significant investment in services or infrastructure. While technology integration is a core functionality of a smart city platform, the real goal must be to enable better decision-making, more responsive services, and increased operational efficiency. The success of a city platform is ultimately to be measured \u2013 and any investment justified \u2013by the ability to support such improvements and not by the elegance of the technical architecture."}

They pledged to put in place by 2020 their new, ambitious climate action plans, to be developed with help from the C40 Cities network. The cities \u2013 spanning the globe from Accra to London to Rio de Janeiro \u2013 will also make clear to their residents the wider social, environmental and economic benefits of stepping up climate action. In addition, C40, which supports cities in tackling climate change, will aid nine large African cities, including Cape Town, Addis Ababa, Lagos and Nairobi, to craft long-term green plans that align with the goals of the 2015 Paris deal to curb global warming, with backing from the German government. \u201dAfrican cities are playing a leading and decisive role in delivering on the ambition of the Paris Agreement,\u201d Paris Mayor and C40 chair Anne Hidalgo said in a statement. Separately, the almost 7,500 cities in the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy said their commitments combined would equal the reduction of nearly 1.3 billion tonnes of carbon emissions per year by 2030 \u2013 the size of Japan or Brazil\u2019s emissions, said Christiana Figueres, vice chair of the alliance. It also launched a new global standard for measuring and reporting emissions from cities and local governments, to be applied from 2018. The aim is to give national governments \u201cvery stringent and robust information\u201d so that as 2020 draws near \u2013 the time by which they need to have peaked emissions to keep climate change in check \u2013 they can \u201cincrease their ambition safely and with confidence because so much has actually been achieved by the cities already\u201d, said former UN climate chief Figueres. Bonn, for example, has recently put in smart street lighting that only switches on when someone passes by, together with a system that detects when recycling bins for clothing and glass are full, so that they are emptied only when needed. Stepped-up action to cut planet-warming emissions would lead to a \u201cmuch, much better\u201d quality of life in cities, including cleaner air and less concrete, Figueres told a summit of local and regional leaders on the sidelines of UN climate talks in Bonn.  Financing\n Financing Figueres and a number of city officials stressed the need to find more finance for municipalities to build greener infrastructure and use more renewable energy. European Commission VP Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the common emissions measuring standard could be \u201ca good selling point for mayors\u201d to attract private-sector investors by helping demonstrate the positive impact of low-carbon projects. Mauricio Rodas Espinel, the mayor of Ecuador\u2019s capital, said Quito is working with other local governments on a plan to enlist G20 governments and international financial institutions to find funding for climate action in cities around the world. It hopes to launch the effort at a French climate summit in December. Money could be used, for example, to expand Quito\u2019s plan to turn its historic district into a clean public transport area, using electric buses and taxis, and copy it across Latin America. In California, a US state with a range of green policies, a state goal says 50% of energy must come from renewable sources by 2030. But Governor Jerry Brown noted that California has 40 million people and 32 million vehicles, with the number of cars growing at a faster rate than the population. He urged local authorities to think about changing building standards and waste management systems to cut carbon pollution, while encouraging citizens to switch to electric vehicles, use bicycles or walk. Planning more compact cities could also help, Brown said. In the United States, even if the administration of President Donald Trump has spurned climate action in favour of promoting fossil fuels, cities still have some power to pursue low-carbon policies, thanks to the federal system of government, he said. \u201cWe have a vital opportunity to take the next steps to deal with climate change,\u201d he told the local leaders\u2019 summit."}
{"_id": "15299247059_10155788274412060", "source_name": "EURACTIV", "title": "The sharing economy: Cure or curse?", "content": " From mobility services to recycling applications, the sharing economy holds many promises. Whether to regulate it at European level remains a disputed question, however. Sharing economy applications can take multiple forms and function with sometimes very different underlying philosophies, said Lud\u011bk Niedermayer, a Czech lawmaker from the centre-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP) in the European Parliament. There is however a common aspect. \u201cEverything we talk about is basically an attempt to use the assets we have in a better and more effective way,\u201d Niedermayer remarked during a public debate in Brno, Czech Republic. In the mobility sector, a wide range of applications are on offer, which go beyond the familiar Uber ride-hailing service. Examples include Waze, a travelling time-saving app, and Robo-taxi, a self-driving service, said Kry\u0161tof Kruli\u0161, an analyst at the Association for International Affairs (AMO). \u201cFirst there is basic carpooling, where you only donate gas money to the driver and he does not make a profit in any other way. This is a classic example of sharing economy,\u201d Kruli\u0161 said, referring to BlaBlaCar, a popular application in France. \u201cThere are other concepts as well. For example carsharing, where you make your car available for others to use. They do not need to go to a car rental company, but rather look on a map which car is the nearest and then pick it up right away,\u201d the researcher explained. According to Kruli\u0161, this could decrease the demand for cars in cities. Studies show that one shared car could replace up to ten private vehicles. \u201cOf course, then there is Uber which looked like a carpooling service at first, but gradually turned into contractual transport service, where you know the price and destination beforehand. There are differences when comparing with the traditional taxi, but currently Uber drivers are becoming more professional and fulfilling the same requirements as taxi drivers,\u201d Kruli\u0161 explained.  \u0160koda and the future of mobility\n \u0160koda and the future of mobility Czech automaker \u0160koda is also interested in new mobility services. The company established a centre called DigiLab, which tests and develops new ideas, primarily in the areas of transport and mobility. \u201cMaking cars will not be sufficient in the future. That is the reason \u0160koda Auto DigiLab exists \u2013 it finds alternative ways to get people from point A to point B,\u201d said Jan Edlman, who works at the Czech automaker\u2019s subsidiary. The company focuses on the ecosystem around the car, more effective parking, and traffic management. One of its creations is HoppyGo \u2013 a carsharing service that connects car owners and drivers in need of transport. All is done using a mobile phone application. According to Edlman, the service is growing quickly and currently offers around seven hundred cars, whether \u0160kodas or other brands.  Regulation, yes or no?\n Regulation, yes or no? One of the questions that inevitably come\u00a0up with the sharing economy is whether or not it should be regulated at European level. For Czech MEP Niedermayer, the answer is no. \u201cThe European Commission says it welcomes the concept of sharing economy\u00a0but does not recommend interfering in these services. Analyses presented by the executive say a clear \u2018no\u2019 to regulation. For me, that is the right approach,\u201d Niedermayer said. Not everyone agrees, however. Kruli\u0161, for one, objected saying a common definition of the sharing economy and basic rules applicable across European countries would ultimately benefit users. \u201cIt would not be easy to find common ground \u2013 the rules are different everywhere, from Berlin to Paris. The question is whether it would be worth the effort to find universal limits,\u201d he suggested. Everyone at the conference agreed, however, that the new business models permitted by the sharing economy raise\u00a0a range of potential issues, starting with the risk of monopolies dominating the market. \u201cThe first issue is to have fair rules for everybody. It just isn\u2019t right for two very similar Czech services to come under completely different rules. The next problem is taxes: it is quite difficult to apply tax laws on large multinational companies. Consumer safety can become an issue as well,\u201d Niedermayer said. But the Czech MEP also referred to the subsidiarity principle, which states that the EU should only regulate if lower levels of government are unable to do it better. \u201cThe benefits and problems of the sharing economy are very often local. Cities and municipalities therefore represent more suitable actors in the process of dealing with them. A lot can be done on the national level as well, so from my point of view we do not need any broad EU legislation,\u201d Niedermayer said.  A problem called Airbnb\n A problem called Airbnb Airbnb, the popular home renting service, is another example where the possible effects of EU regulation could be felt in the near future. \u201cIf we want from Airbnb the same level of consumer protection and the same level of service as in a regular hotel, it might spell the end of this economic segment. The matter is whether we think it should provide this level of service, or whether we accept that it is a completely different concept and lower our expectations,\u201d Niedermayer said. The other issue with Airbnb is its real-life impact on the housing market. \u201cAirbnb is a great option for travellers,\u201d he said, but the proliferation of home rentals also pushes up the price of flats in cities. \u201cFor some, it means a lucrative opportunity, for others, higher prices of property,\u201d the Czech MEP explained.  Saving resources, creating social ties\n Saving resources, creating social ties Participants at the conference also highlighted the impact of the sharing economy on the environment as well as on social interactions. Younger people in the 21st century can sometimes lack social interactions, Niedermayer said. \u201cSharing something might reverse this trend,\u201d he suggested, saying communities can be nurtured in this way, creating some form of \u201cintimacy\u201d to participants. Beyond mobility, the concept of \u201csmart\u201d cities is also raising the interest of local authorities in the sharing economy. Cities like Brno have their own \u201csmart\u201d strategy which aims at improving coordination between different levels of city management, said Jan Edlman. \u201cCities should provide comfort and security. \u2018Smart\u2019 city from our point of view means close relations between the city, its citizens and companies,\u201d Edlman said. The environmental level of the sharing economy is about using resources more efficiently and creating a circular economy. \u201cFor example, when you don\u2019t like your mobile phone anymore, you don\u2019t throw it away, because other people with lower requirements in other countries might still use it. At the very end, parts from the phone might be used as well,\u201d Niedermayer said."}

It is clear that we don\u2019t have the luxury of decades to deploy new technologies\u00a0if climate action is to outpace climate change. Their large scale deployment will require smart investments by governments followed by smart investments by the private sector.\u00a0The roles of public and private actors, though different, are equally important. They complement each other.  Public-private partnerships vital\n Public-private partnerships vital  for the leap forward \n for the leap forward Public investment has accelerated since the Mission Innovation\u2019s launch in 2015. Its 23 members stretched across five continents \u2013 and representing 75% of the global CO2 emissions from electricity \u2013 are on track to double their clean energy R&D investment by the end of this decade. Until now, we have seen additional $4 billion channelled into this field. The EU alone is set to step up its contribution by committing \u20ac10 billion through the Horizon 2020 programme during the five-year period. It is significant. But it is not only about the amount of money that public actors put on the table. We are very good at creating knowledge with money. We are, however, struggling to make money out of this knowledge. A big task is to bridge the so-called \u201cValley of death\u201d to deploy new technologies at industrial scale and faster. In other words, we must shorten the time to market. I believe that public-private partnerships are vital to achieving this leap forward. Especially as the private sector investment in clean energy innovation has stagnated. That is why we are discussing the ways to use public resources smartly to de-risk, leverage and incentivise private investment in disruptive clean tech. We\u2019re stepping up our game through the concrete initiatives announced this week, and among them, the\u00a0initiative supporting innovators. Drawing on a \u201cBold Idea\u201d from the World Economic Forum, we are setting up a public-private co-investment platform for clean energy that would see the so-called business angels \u2013 pre-selected and trustworthy private investors \u2013 helping us decide where both, public and private investors should co-invest. Moreover, during the Cleantech Capital Day, 30 innovative start-ups have a chance to pitch their project to a panel of investors. The EIB or Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Coalition will be present. During the so-called Hackaton, 60 young innovators and entrepreneurs, including students, are tasked with coming up with tech solutions to specific challenges faced by cities. The winning idea will be presented at the Smart City World Expo in Barcelona later this year to see how to scale it up.  Cities as \u2018living labs\u2019 \n Cities as \u2018living labs\u2019 Cities play a central role in accelerating widespread clean energy innovation. They have become incubators for new green technologies, often the first to dare implement them and test their impact.\u00a0Just imagine areas such as e-mobility, energy storage, smart and efficient buildings or waste management solutions. Therefore, I am glad that from now on, the cities dimension is on Mission Innovation\u2019s radar, connecting the cities and innovation agenda. After all, it is estimated that by 2050, up to 70% of the world\u2019s population will live in urban areas. The Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy \u2013 a unique coalition of thousands of cities around the globe \u2013 is hosting a roundtable to galvanise cities-focused climate science. We need to address critical knowledge, data and innovation gaps in order to boost cities\u2019 climate action. Cities need more and better data \u2013 big and small \u2013 not only to provide insights into why and how climate change is happening\u00a0but also to inform their climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. The Innovate4Cities \u2013 a global climate action accelerator, which we are developing \u2013 will focus on some of the most critical areas to drive climate action in cities as well as provide local governments and practitioners with city-level data. Some inspiration can be found in large-scale demonstration projects within the \u201cSmart and Sustainable Cities\u201d program, which have received \u20ac450 million from Horizon 2020. Cities that participate in this program actively engage in public-private-people partnerships; they commit to open innovation and co-creation processes; in real-world conditions, they co-develop and test solutions combining digital, technological, social and nature-based innovation; they explore and develop new governance, finance and business models. When these models turn out to be effective and attract private investments, they can be further replicated and upscaled. I am convinced that it is this action at the local level that is going to help us meet the goals of the Paris Agreement."}

Is the world on track for a repeat of the resource boom seen in the early 21st century? The global fight for natural resources was nearing an all-time high when the European Commission first laid out an EU strategy for raw materials, back in 2008. \u201cA strong and unforeseen surge in demand\u201d driven essentially by double-digit growth in China, had led to a tripling of metal prices between 2002 and 2008, the Commission said at the time. China, the world\u2019s de facto sole supplier of rare earth metals, took advantage of its monopolistic position to impose restrictions on exports, prompting Japan to start stockpiling in fear of a supply crunch. At the European level, those concerns resulted in the establishment of a \u201craw materials diplomacy\u201d to secure supplies from abroad \u2013 including legal action at the WTO when necessary \u2013 a push for resource-efficiency inside Europe, and the creation of a list of critical raw materials to monitor potential supply risks. Those fears were quickly swept away by the financial crisis, which depressed the global economy for many years. But ten years later, the fundamental economic trends that fuelled EU worries at the time are still there. If anything, those trends have intensified, driven by the continuous digitialisation of the economy and the transition to renewable energies.  \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d raw materials\n \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d raw materials \u201cIt\u2019s already happening,\u201d said Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European Commission\u2019s vice-president for the Energy Union, when asked about fears that raw materials prices could start rising again. \u201cAll the focus now in the European Commission is to reduce dependency on fossil fuels,\u201d he told EURACTIV in an interview. \u201cThis is why we are looking at access to raw materials with increased scrutiny,\u201d he added, saying the objective was to avoid trading dependency on imported oil and gas with dependency on imported raw materials. \u201cI really think that, when it comes to the issue of dependency, we could end up in a situation where raw materials become the new oil,\u201d he warned. To illustrate his point, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d likes to produce one statistic about the materials necessary to produce a\u00a03 megawatt wind turbine.\u00a0Manufacturing one of those requires 335 tonnes of steel, 4.7 tonnes of copper, 1,200 tonnes of concrete, 3 tonnes of aluminium, 2 tonnes of rare earth elements as well as zinc, he says. \u201cFor me that is really illustrative of the volume of raw materials you need for the green transition,\u201d he told EURACTIV. Critical raw materials \u201care irreplaceable in solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient lighting\u201d which are essential for the energy transition, the European Commission said in its latest Report on Critical Raw Materials and the Circular Economy , published in January 2018. Everyday consumer products in the telecoms sector are also highly exposed to raw materials price fluctuations.\u00a0\u201cA smartphone might contain up to 50 different metals\u201d all of which provide essential properties to the final product, the EU executive remarked, pointing to the importance of critical raw materials for high-tech products. And the majority of these primary raw materials are produced and supplied from non-European countries, the report pointed out: Nowadays, industry people say supply risks are driven mainly by emerging demand for new products such as electric cars. \u201cRaw materials will be essential for manufacturing the products of the future. They form the basis of modern societies, our cities, digitalisation and the European energy transition,\u201d said Roman Stiftner Secretary-General of the European Mineral Resources Confederation (EUMICON). \u201cMegatrends such as digitalisation and the decarbonisation of transport and production are resulting in new demand for raw materials, in terms of volume and of complexity,\u201d EUMICON said in its raw materials charter , published earlier this year. Other megatrends identified by EUMICON include increased wealth and global population growth. Global GDP is ten times higher than 50 years ago, and the world\u2019s population has doubled. A further 3 billion people are expected to join the middle-class between 2010 and 2030, and all of them will want cars and smartphones. Meanwhile, urbanisation, digitalisation, the low-carbon transition and the switch to electricity as the main source of energy for industry are further accelerating developments, it says. \u201cElectricity demand is rising, while increased production of wind and solar energy requires a greater quantity of a different mix of raw materials,\u201d EUMICON pointed out, wondering whether the world has entered \u201ca new age for metals and minerals\u201d. To be sure, the digital revolution that was already underway ten years ago has accelerated and branched out into new areas, creating excitement around things like robotics, smart cities, industry 4.0, electric vehicles, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence, to name a few buzzwords. On the manufacturing side, concepts have evolved. The European Commission\u2019s resource-efficiency agenda of 2011 has morphed into a more ambitious circular economy strategy, which places recycling at the centre of attempts to close raw material loops and keep valuable resources inside Europe.  New risks, new solutions\n New risks, new solutions However, recycling has its limits, even under the most optimistic scenarios. \u201cThe overall demand for raw materials is growing, and recycling alone cannot supply the market,\u201d EUMICON said, citing aluminium as a case in point. And \u201csince recycling efforts will not be sufficient to feed the demand, supply of primary raw materials is irreplaceable,\u201d it argues, calling for \u201cnew solutions\u201d to establish \u201ca future-proof raw materials policy\u201d. This includes exploiting Europe\u2019s own geological deposits as well as securing access to raw materials on global markets to strengthen the future resilience of European industry. But is Europe \u2013 and indeed the world \u2013 better equipped to deal with those global challenges today than it was ten years ago? From a technological point of view, maybe yes. But from a global trade perspective, definitely not. Under President Trump, the United States has taken a hostile stance against Europe and China on trade, launching attacks on all fronts, ranging from steel to cars and food, raising the spectre of a new global trade war. China itself has long pursued unilateral policies on access to raw materials, cutting deals with resource-rich African countries in return for cheap loans and infrastructure. This makes the current trade environment more volatile than it was ten years ago, under a more accommodating Obama administration and a less assertive China. \u201cThis time around, governments seem to be taking a more assertive, and in some cases, pre-emptive stance,\u201d according to the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), a think-tank. \u201cWitness, for example, China\u2019s disputes on rare earth elements or President Trump\u2019s Mineral Order at the end of 2017. This new attitude may pose new challenges for EU trade policy,\u201d CEPS wrote in a policy paper published in February .  A future \u2018Made in Europe\u2019?\n A future \u2018Made in Europe\u2019? Faced with those challenges, Europe has also taken a more assertive stance, launching WTO disputes against Chinese export restrictions on raw materials such as graphite, cobalt, copper, lead and chromium. In his latest State of the Union speech, Jean-Claude Juncker proposed a new \u2018 Africa-Europe Alliance \u2019 that hopes to tap \u201cthe full potential of economic integration and trade,\u201d with an\u00a0objective to leverage up to \u20ac44 billion of investments into the region by 2020. At home, the European Commission has targeted an increase in the recovery of key raw materials as part of its Circular Economy Strategy put forward in 2015, placing the emphasis on recycling and reuse with a view to \u201cclosing the loop\u201d of product lifecycles. Supporting innovation in European recycling technologies is also part of that plan. But EUMICON says technological solutions, although necessary, won\u2019t go far enough to meet the challenges Europe is facing. \u201cA complete approach to sustainability requires us to consider economic, environmental and social sustainability together,\u201d EUMICON said, stressing that \u201call three aspects need to be addressed with equal focus\u201d in order to ensure a future that is \u201cMade in Europe\u201d. What it boils down to is the importance of strengthening raw material value chains in Europe at a time when the international trade order is being challenged. \u201cThe EU will need to develop a proper thinking how to put raw materials in the centre of its industry strategy, since we will be facing a new global race for raw materials in the future,\u201d said Gilbert Rukschcio, managing partner at Pantarhei Advisors, a consulting firm based in Austria. \u201cGlobal megatrends such as digitalisation and the energy transition will also force Europe to act on this field,\u201d Rukschcio said."}

Their contribution is focused on reducing emissions, building resilience and decreasing vulnerability to climate change and promoting cooperation for exchanging best practice. A precondition for achieving any of the above is complete ownership of an energy transition and climate change adaptation and mitigation agenda. Therefore, all proposed measures that I refer to are interdependent pieces of a long-term strategy that have multiplying effects and sustainable outcomes. This strategy has four pillars. First, improving the energy mix through a stronger contribution from renewables will be vital. This applies not only to reducing emissions but also to ensuring energy security and sustainability of supply. For example, local public transport could begin using biofuels. All but three member states are below the 10 per cent threshold for 2020 when it comes to energy from renewable sources in transport. There is clearly room for improvement. Second, the circular economy plays a large part in a long-term climate strategy for cities and regions. Efficient waste management remains a priority, since despite significant improvements over the past decades, more than a quarter of municipal waste is still landfilled and less than half is recycled. This also creates a window of opportunity for smart solutions. For example, in Vilnius, the European fund for strategic investments is backing up the greenfield construction of a combined-heat-and-power plant in the city of Vilnius. The project, which is expected to leverage \u20ac226m, will lower municipal landfilling, reduce emissions in comparison to fossil-fuels and subsequently improve Lithuania\u2019s energy security. Any measure to improve the energy efficiency of buildings has an impact on the local economy. Energy renovations and the construction of new nearly zero-energy buildings will reduce energy demand and therefore also energy costs. Improving energy efficiency will have an indirect effect on the economy, since energy renovations are estimated to add almost twice as much value to the economy as the construction of new buildings. Several projects funded through the investment plan could be replicated for public buildings. Renovations of existing residential buildings in France and Finland will deliver energy savings and boost the local construction economy. Similar projects, which would pool public buildings for energy renovation, could be deployed at local and regional level. Local and regional authorities may be at the forefront of adopting energy and climate initiatives, but sometimes lack the resources or capacity to implement them. This requires support at national or European level. Here are two examples from Greece. First, the country\u2019s beautiful but energy-hungry islands, which cost Greek citizens an average of \u20ac800m annually for their energy needs. This is because their energy infrastructures are fossil-fuelled and there are limited interconnections with continental Greece and the central grid. We must push for energy interconnections at national level, and we must also support the increased contribution of renewables in islands\u2019 energy mix. My second example is drawn from a recent visit to western Macedonia. This region is the main producer of lignite, the basic component of Greece\u2019s electricity production. Europe is pushing for decarbonisation, whereas the local economy\u2019s strong dependence on a finite resource lignite, to the extent creating of monoculture. This paints a smoggy picture for the area\u2019s future. The Commission\u2019s pilot initiative, \u2018Coal regions in transition\u2019, is extremely helpful and replicable. It aims to facilitate the transition of regions and cities, through economic diversification, the improvement of air-quality and the re-education of the local workforce. Cities and regions have the opportunity to think and act outside of the box and improve citizens\u2019 lives while implementing the COP21 Paris agreement. However, it is important for member states to encourage them in their plans. For this reason, change in national planning on climate change adaption and mitigation is needed, particularly for countries in southern Europe. "}

The di\u00acfferent modes of transport that we choose play a significant role in providing overall connectivity, shaping our urban areas, impacting travel safety, space allocation, respiratory health and much more. Opting for walking, cycling and collective modes of transport can have a positive impact not only on our quality of life, but also on our cities. Nowadays, we can recast transport as a means to enhance our lives and connectivity. Using digital technology means we can plan our trips, more e\u00acffectively we can catch up with reading on the metro, improve our health by walking or cycling, or send o\u00ac some urgent emails on the train. Smoother, more seamless transport can also translate into a financial benefit for society. For instance, congestion alone is estimated to cost around \u20ac100bn - one per cent of the EU\u2019s GDP - each year. If cities were to invest in modern and smart infrastructure, including for cycling and walking, in comparable amounts to that invested in motorised transport, congestion times across all modes could be cut considerably. Urban mobility also accounts for 40 per cent of all CO2 emissions of road transport - a figure that can be greatly improved, particularly as Europe strives to improve the quality of life in cities and to meet its commitment under the Paris agreement. If we have the willingness to test out new ways of moving, and our political leaders have the courage to support the necessary legislative changes or infrastructural improvements to encourage sustainable means of transport, we could enhance our well-being and make our cities even more pleasant places to live and work in. European Mobility Week, which takes place from 16-22 September each year, seeking to improve quality of life and public health through promoting clean mobility and sustainable urban transport. It is a flagship EU awareness-raising campaign, organised with the political and financial support of the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport of the European Commission. The campaign gives people the chance to explore the role of mobility in their daily lives and to experiment with practical solutions to urban challenges, such as air pollution and road safety. Last year saw a record number of participants, with over 2,500 towns and cities from 50 countries taking part in the campaign. Its popularity has even spread beyond Europe, with towns and cities in the United States, South Korea, Japan, and Mexico all registering. Each edition of European Mobility Week is held under a di\u00acfferent theme. European transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc has called for 2018 to be designated the \u2018Year of Multimodality\u2019, which will be the focus of this edition. Multimodality is the mixing of transport modes within the same journey or for di\u00acfferent trips. Many of us instinctively opt for the same method of transport (usually the car) without thinking about the already many available alternatives. Often, by combining these alternatives we can make our trip more efficient, more cost-e\u00acffective, more enjoyable and more sustainable. Embracing multimodality is down to individual choice, but there are a number of measures that can be taken by local authorities to make the concept more attractive. In Vienna, the city has developed a \u201cMobility as a Service (MaaS)\u201d application for mobile phones, which makes it easier for residents to plan a trip within the city. The app shows how di\u00acfferent forms of transport can be used to achieve the most efficient journey possible. As well as providing real-time information, Vienna\u2019s MaaS platform also enables users to buy tickets online. Low-tech means of stimulating multimodality can also be highly e\u00acffective. In Esch sur Alzette in Luxembourg, the local authorities installed signposts for pedestrians that indicate distances in walking time. Thanks to these signposts, travellers can decide the most logical way to complete their trip, be it driving, taking public transport or simply walking for a few minutes. One common misperception is that car journeys are relatively cheap compared with public transport. When including the costs of insurance, petrol, upkeep and parking (not to mention the purchase price of the vehicle), the costs quickly add up. By combining driving with cheaper transport modes, such as public transport, or free modes, such as walking or cycling, the long-term savings can often be substantial. For local governments, European Mobility Week provides an excellent opportunity for presenting sustainable mobility alternatives to local residents and for explaining the challenges facing towns and cities. By taking part, towns and cities can showcase the benefits of cleaner transport choices and make progress towards better mobility in Europe. Therefore this September, I encourage all towns and cities, both big and small, to join the campaign and to experience first-hand the benefits of multi-modality. "}

The theme this year is multi-modality. This concept is of crucial importance to urban mobility, both now and in the future. European transport is at a turning point. The sector is stuck between ambitious objectives and considerable constraints and therefore must face numerous challenges with requirements that can be difficult to meet. How can the sector satisfy the growing demand for passenger and commercial transport, so as to avoid hampering EU growth, while reaching the EU\u2019s own objective of reducing transport emissions by 60 per cent by 2050? This is particularly the case for cities - urban areas are responsible for nearly a quarter of transport emissions - and will continue to be in the years to come, as Europe\u2019s urban population grows (73 per cent today, 82 per cent by 2050). There are also problems inherently linked to urban mobility: atmospheric and sound pollution, congestion and chronic traffic jams (estimated to cost \u20ac80bn a year), accidents (38 per cent of road deaths happen in urban areas), logistical flexibility and accessibility of passenger transport. To overcome these challenges and reach these objectives, the EU quickly recognised the importance of multi-modality in its transport policy and its climate objectives. Unfortunately, despite over 30 years of continuous e\u00acfforts to promote a modal shift (to less-polluting modes than road transport) and multi-modality, results have been relatively modest, particularly regarding waterway and rail transport. In the EU, 80 per cent of passenger transport is by private car. Nevertheless, multi-modality in urban zones has regained momentum in recent years, thanks notably to the \u2018mobility as a service\u2019 (MaaS) concept. European cities must contend with the rarefaction of public spaces and money, as well as citizens wanting more pleasant cities to live in. As such, the concept of increasing public spaces dedicated to parking or widening roads in city centres seems somewhat ridiculous - not to mention that such projects come at a huge cost and inevitably take a long time to complete. In fact, quite the opposite is happening, with cities establishing more and more car-free zones. MaaS aims to optimise travel and build upon what already exists. Using new technologies - particularly smartphones - it finds the best travel solution door to door, according to the user\u2019s needs by combining the various modes of public and private transport available (taxi, bus, tram, underground, bike). This tackles the EU\u2019s dependence on private cars for urban transport head-on. According to a 2013 survey, 50 per cent of Europeans citizens use their car every day, compared to 16 per cent that use public transport and 12 per cent that cycle. As a reminder, 95 per cent of the time cars remain parked during the course of a day. For the MaaS system to function efficiently, several conditions need to be in place. There needs to be: a booking and electronic ticketing system (centralised within a single platform or via a smart card); an automatic payment system; high-level of connectivity with adequate digital infrastructure and access to reliable and up to date information on the di\u00acfferent travel options and times. There are also questions of cybersecurity and data protection, collaboration and value sharing between the di\u00acfferent public and private stakeholders, as well as risks (delays and surcharges) - particularly for commercial transport. MaaS poses many challenges. Considering these, and avoiding a messianic vision, the system nonetheless seems to be highly promising, as long as it is properly integrated within a public transport system developed to applications belonging to the sharing economy (for example, car sharing). This potential is heightened by the emergence of driverless cars. According to some, we could reduce car transport by 90 per cent in cities such as Lisbon, while still meeting the demand for mobility. I don\u2019t mean to push for the abolition of private cars, and I have my doubts as to how realistic the above scenario really is, but it is certainly food for thought when it comes to how we view and conceptualise cities and urban spaces in general; no one would object to less congested, less polluted and less clogged cities. There is no miracle solution, no single perfect mode of transport. However, the different modes of transport are far from antagonistic; rather, they complement each other, and this is what will bring forward an effective solution. However, we must take into account the specificities of each area and the reality on the ground. In this sense, multi-modality requires a pragmatic, bottom-up approach. I am therefore delighted that it is the theme of this year\u2019s European mobility week. Cities have a key role to play in developing and encouraging urban projects, local initiatives and best practice. In doing so, they will be able to tackle challenges at local level and contribute the reaching the EU\u2019s ambitious objectives. "}

Facebook said it has temporarily suspended the firm, Crimson Hexagon, while it looks into whether it violated data-sharing policies. Facebook was responding to an inquiry from the Wall Street Journal, which reported that Crimson Hexagon had deals to analyze Facebook data for clients including several U.S. governmental agencies and a Russian organization with Kremlin ties. Facebook said that based on its investigation so far, Crimson Hexagon did not obtain any Facebook or Instagram information inappropriately. Facebook said the analytics company is cooperating with the probe. \"We don't allow developers to build surveillance tools using information from Facebook or Instagram,\" a company rep said in a statement. \"We take these allegations seriously, and we have suspended these apps while we investigate.\" In a blog post Friday, Crimson Hexagon CTO Chris Bingham said the company's governmental customers are allowed to use its platform only for specific approved use cases and that \"under no circumstances is surveillance a permitted use case.\" \"Government entities that leverage the Crimson Hexagon platform do so for the same reasons as many of our other non-government customers: a broad-based and aggregate understanding of the public's perception, preferences and sentiment about matters of concern to them,\" he wrote. In addition, Bingham wrote, Crimson Hexagon collects only publicly available social-media data \"that anyone can access,\" not private data. He noted that the Facebook data accessed by Cambridge Analytica was private. \"What Cambridge Analytica did was explicitly illegal, while the collection of public data is completely legal and sanctioned by the data providers that Crimson engages with, including Twitter and Facebook, among others,\" according to Bingham. Boston-based Crimson Hexagon claims it maintains a database of over 1 trillion social-media posts, including from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and other discussion forums, blogs, and other sources. The company boasts that it has the world's largest volume of unstructured text and images across social, online public, and enterprise-held data sources. Per Facebook's policies, users can opt to share their information with developers on Facebook and Instagram. In addition, the social-media company offers application programming interfaces to let developers use public or aggregated information for business purposes. \"Facebook has a responsibility to help protect people's information which is one of the reasons why we have tightened our APIs significantly over the last few years,\" Ime Archibong, Facebook's VP of product partnerships, said in a statement. According to Crimson Hexagon's website, customers include Paramount Pictures, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Adidas, General Mills, General Motors and Twitter. The company was founded in 2007 by chairman Gary King, a professor at Harvard University and director of the university's Institute for Quantitative Social Science. Investors in Crimson Hexagon include Great Oaks Venture Capital and Sageview Capital. The situation with Crimson Hexagon comes after revelations about info on up to 87 million Facebook users may have been improperly sold via a third-party researcher with Cambridge Analytica, a firm that worked for Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to target Facebook users. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica flap, Facebook said it suspended 200 third-party apps that had access to large amounts of user info pending review of whether they misused that data. Facebook claims it changed its policies in 2014 to prevent apps from accessing info on users' friends in the way that led to the harvesting of data that wound up on Cambridge Analytica's servers."}

We even welcome it. There is however considerable resistance to state surveillance, because even with checks and balances and the rule of law, the suspicion remains that an unscruplous government could abuse the system. The police forces already have an arsenal of cameras and technology that can be deployed to recognise faces or even morphology in a crowd, and these can be used to arrest troublemakers at a protest, or trade union leaders during a strike, for example. If phone company records are accessible, our movements can be tracked, and our behaviour analysed. In our interconnected world, privacy is being eroded by the day. Companies increasingly use technology to steer our purchases and advertise things to us before we even know we must have them. Simply good business for some, sharp practise for others. However now the Chinese government is taking the plethora of tools available and binding them together in an all-encompassing system of social monitoring and control the likes of which the world has never seen outside the pages of \"1984\" or an episode of \"Black Mirror\". And while the Chinese people have little say in whether or not they are going to allow a system like this to take over their daily lives, in the developed world we do. Yet we may be sleepwalking our way towards a nightmare should any other government decide to implement such a system - and we can be sure some are studying the Chinese example very closely. The Chinese \"Social Credits\" system is up and running. In 2014 Beijing published the \"Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System (2014-2020)\", and wasted little time in implementing it. Its promoters insist it is to reinforce \"trust\" in Chinese society, especially in the field of business regulation, determining people's credit-worthiness, and cracking down on fraud and financial crime, which costs the country dear. It is especially important in a country where few people have a credit history, and banks are desperate to extend credit to more and more people, chasing custom. Take for example Zhima Credit, a subsidiary of online retailing ginat AliBaba. It examines people's behaviour to determine their credit-worthiness, so buying nappies is an indication of parenthood, (read: responsible adult), while spending time playing computer games is a sign you're just a slacker. Your \"social credit score\" can go up or down, and ig it goes too low, you are denied a loan. It goes beyond what you personally do. If you have a neighbour or friend who has fallen foul of the system and has a low social credit score, simply saying \"good morning\" to them might trigger a network response downgrading your score. Those with high scores find they get benefits, like no-deposit hotle rooms for example, or airline upgrades. Those with low scores may not even be allowed to get on the plane. What is deemed good or bad behaviour is centrally determined by the government or local authority. One city is giving its citizens a lump sum of points, then deducting them for, say, littering, or adding them for \"good\" behaviour and honouring them with their photos displayed in public. Offenders might find it hard to get a government job, or the school of their choice for their children. Mass surveillance has existed in totalitarian states before. The Stasi in the former East Germany was especially good at it, turning people into informers on the people around them. What is new is that China is forging a nexus of mass surveillance with big data and Artificial Intelligence in which there will be few or no cracks. This will extend to international companies and their employees doing business in China, and the tens of millions of Chinese in the diaspora. Venezuela introduced electronic ration cards in 2014 and ever since there have been accusations only people loyal to the Maduro government have been allowed access to certain vital supplies. The Soviet Union also practiced a similar scheme, but just imagine how much deeper and far-ranging China's system could be, with all the advantages of AI and Big Data at its disposal. Do enough to displease the authorities, and it seems easy to become a \"non-person\". Now imagine it happening in the US, or Europe. Some have called the Chinese system the beginning of the end of free will. Now the technology exists the overwhelming tempation will be to use it. Only we, the people, can prevent an IT-supported authoritarianism from happening. For the moment China is busy integrating a multitude of datbases from companies, local authorities, and state entities, so Big Brother is not yet entirely omnipotent...yet. But come 2020 the whole project is supposed to form a seamless whole, so woe betide any dissenters then."}

What we need to do for the future is to look at more proactive systems, systems by design, security by design. It\u2019s not about additional software we add to the devices, rather it\u2019s about building these devices in a secure way right from the start.\u201d  PyeongChang Olympics: a hyper-connected event\n The security questions notwithstanding, the drive to offer consumers 5G services is rushing ahead, with South Korea planning to make its upcoming Winter Olympics a hyper-connected event . \u201cWe are trying to install the 5G network for the first time in the world to provide trial services for the audience and the participants in the Olympic Games,\u201d explained Dongjun Lee, network strategy specialist at KT Corporation. Many of the attendees of ITU Telecom World will be watching those 5G Olympic trials eagerly, as the world prepares for another big jump in connectivity."}

Recent electoral outcomes \u2013 perhaps most notably, the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the presidential election in the United States \u2013 have highlighted rising economic uncertainty. In this environment, it is imperative that leaders articulate and deliver on a clear vision for inclusive economic growth, one that accounts not only for tax and trade policy \u2013 the focus of many of today\u2019s debates \u2013 but also for digitization. Representing $19 trillion in potential economic value over the next decade, digitization has the power to enable countries to kick-start GDP growth, job creation, and innovation. We\u2019re already seeing the profound impact that digitization can have on countries that embrace it as a core driver of their economic strategies. In India, for example, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is implementing a strategy that is transforming India into a technology powerhouse and setting the stage for a digital future. In France, the government has invested in an extensive national digital plan that is expected to create 1.1 million jobs over the next 3-5 years and contribute $101 billion to GDP over the next decade. While other countries are embracing robust digital strategies, the US is falling behind. Despite having led the Internet race in the 1990s, the US is now the only major developed economy without a clear digitization plan. The consequences are already starting to show: according to the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index , the US is now the world\u2019s eighth most innovative country, having fallen two spots since 2015. The message is clear: when it comes to digitization, nobody is entitled to anything, and there is no time to waste. Even in Silicon Valley, we must constantly reinvent ourselves to stay competitive. The US economy must do the same, or risk losing its innovative edge. Only with a clear and effective digitization plan can the US ensure that it retains its status as a global economic leader in the Digital Age, while fulfilling its citizens\u2019 demands for more economic opportunities. I believe that connectivity has the power to transform economies and generate new opportunities. That is why America\u2019s new digital agenda must rectify the fact that, despite living in one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, one-third of the US population still lacks broadband access at home. Existing Smart City initiatives promoting connectivity in Chicago and Washington, DC, are encouraging. But, to close the digital divide, a more comprehensive national digital strategy is needed, one that emphasizes digital infrastructure investment, rather than just physical infrastructure investment, as in the past. Only with broad access can technology continue to fulfill its potential as one of the great economic equalizers. An effective US digitization plan must also support start-ups. Young companies represent the future of job creation \u2013 they are the primary source of new jobs in the US \u2013 and technological disruption. Yet start-ups are on the decline in the US. According to research by the Brookings Institution, the start-up rate (the number of new companies, as a percentage of all firms) has fallen by nearly half since 1978. To boost innovation and job creation, we need to reverse this trend, injecting more fuel into the US economy\u2019s start-up engine. This will require businesses and government to work together to create an environment that encourages entrepreneurs to bring their visions to life. A combination of legislation, such as tax benefits for early-stage companies, and corporate/venture capital investments that provide financial backing and mentorship opportunities to start-ups, will be vital to sustain this ecosystem. More broadly, US leaders must create an environment that encourages all kinds of business growth and investment. Trump\u2019s call to update US tax rules in 2017 could produce benefits on this front, assuming that the new rules promote domestic investment by encouraging companies to bring back their overseas earnings and by lowering the corporate tax rate, currently one of the highest among OECD countries. These steps could bring more than $1 trillion into the US economy, creating jobs and economic opportunities in the process. Yet another critical element of an effective digitization plan is education and training. Businesses need to invest in the existing workforce, which largely lacks the skills necessary to compete in the Digital Age. At the same time, we must transform our education system, so that younger generations acquire the skills they need to secure the high-paying digital jobs of the future. To this end, we must move beyond emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \u2013 the so-called STEM subjects \u2013 to think about how to apply technology and digitization to all fields. Digitization could create $5.1 trillion in economic value for the US by 2025, while significantly lowering unemployment. But the US cannot realize this potential unless its leaders work effectively across party lines and with all industries to drive forward a digital agenda. Technology is changing everything: the way we do business, the rules of capitalism, and entire economic ecosystems \u2013 all at tremendous speed. The US must change with it, acting now to do what it takes to reclaim its innovative edge and thrive in the Digital Age.

The digitalisation of the economy is expected to disrupt production processes, the world of work and society at large. But we still don\u2019t have a clear idea of what this so-called digitalisation entails and its likely social impacts. Will employees become mere executors of machines? How do we make an \u2018inclusive\u2019 robotisation that will benefit all those affected? Will digital platforms give rise to a parallel, insecure labour market? What role do employers and unions play in this emerging new world? There is a serious lack of relevant data and many unanswered questions. Dramatically simplify the concept of the \u2018digitalisation of the economy\u2019 into two parts is a good place to start. On the one hand, there is artificial intelligence (AI) and robotisation in all its forms. This encompasses all the computerisation and automation phenomena that enable robots to carry out non-routine manual and cognitive tasks. Robots may be either tangible (like smart factories, driverless cars, 3D printers) or virtual (such as software, algorithms). On the other, there is the platform economy as a new business model. It has been made possible because of ubiquitous connectivity, data and mobile devices that allow people to network via digital platforms (such as Facebook and LinkedIn), to have access to new services (like Uber and Airbnb), e-commerce (Amazon, leboncoin.fr, etc.), and in particular to develop new business models based on online outsourcing (including Upwork and Amazon Mechanical Turk). This platform economy has brought a new player into the labor markets: the \u2018crowd\u2019 of disseminated workers all over the globe, available 24/7 and often ready to work at very low rates. So how are these two components changing society and how can we address them?  The \u2018robot\u2019\n The social challenges posed by AI and robotisation are significant, yet their \u2018disruptive\u2019 nature depends largely on the level of industrialisation of countries and regions. Consideration must also be given not only to industrial robotisation but to the virtual robotisation that already pervades in offices. From online banking to self-checkout aisles at supermarkets, to performing medical diagnoses and predicting sales volumes, automation and dematerialisation of increasing numbers of tasks in trade, distribution, banking, insurance and other sectors bring about profound changes in the organisation of work and a gradual erosion of traditional jobs. The major questions concern the digitalisation of tasks, jobs and workplaces, the changes in value chains in industry and the potential relocation of sites and employment. Traditional issues regarding the quality of jobs also arise with respect to flexibility and security, health and safety (e.g. in human-machine interaction), working time, skills, work-life balance and managerial monitoring. The European trade union movement has some tools and institutions to cope with these challenges, which can be addressed in dialogue with management and labour groups across different industries, collective bargaining and works councils. The main aim is to anticipate changes and, in the worst scenarios, to foster socially responsible restructuring. However, fresh attention must be given to developments in the organisation of work enabled by new technologies: how far can robotisation go, how should it be conceived in its interactions with workers, and what new management methods will it call for? Will employees become mere executors of the machines (including AI), or will they be involved in the automation processes? How to proceed to an \u2018inclusive\u2019 robotisation that will benefit all those affected? As the new technologies offer a whole range of monitoring tools, how do we ensure that surveillance of employees\u2019 work remains proportionate and respects their privacy? Trade unions and employers must consider all these topics as important subjects for discussion and negotiation.  The \u2018crowd\u2019 of workers\n New technologies have enabled the rapid development of the second phenomenon, the new business model known as digital platforms. Unlike robotisation, the social challenges in this area are totally disruptive. This can be seen mainly in two major categories of services: local services such as passenger transport, catering, cleaning (well-known examples are Uber, and Deliveroo), and online outsourcing platforms used by companies for tasks that can be carried out remotely by computer (such as Upwork and AMT). The main concerns with these digital platforms are the trend towards deregulation and the failure to comply with social legislation. There is a risk of regulated jobs being \u2018siphoned off\u2019 by these new forms of work, giving rise to a kind of parallel and often insecure labor market that does not always comply with the social, tax and regulatory provisions that govern standard workers: no employment relationship, no applicable social legislation, no collective bargaining, and no social security. These online outsourcing platforms undoubtedly pose the most difficult challenge for the trade unions: how to find ways to organise workers above and beyond their status and country? This is a huge challenge since it involves retirees, students, unemployed, migrants, disabled or precarious workers from all over the world. These workers need to build new forms of collective organization. Some self-organising groups have emerged recently, for instance, the Uber Drivers Network in the US, the \u201cSyndicat des VTC\u201d in France, the initiative \u201cFairCrowdWork\u201d launched in Germany (IGMetall), Austria (\u00d6GB) and Sweden (Unionen). But they remain the exception. But they remain the exception. The trade unions are also trying to negotiate the establishment of works councils for some of these platforms (such as Foodora in Vienna), and collective agreements (for example the Hilfr cleaning services platform in Denmark). But these initiatives remain relatively isolated, and the termination of Deliveroo's collaboration with the Smart cooperative in Belgium shows the difficulty of the task - and the reluctance of major platforms to engage with social organisations. In addition, these initiatives only concern platforms of local services, not those of online outsourcing.  Societal challenges\n Finally, the digitalisation of the economy could give rise to new trends or accentuate existing trends in our societies: social polarisation, increased inequalities, hollowing out of the middle class. More than a decade ago, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was set up to provide support to people losing their jobs as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. While much more needs to be done to understand digitalisation, it may be advisable to take inspiration from this initiative and create a similar fund for adjustment to digitalisation to help those who could be left behind by the digital transformation. As the polarisation of society is accompanied by an erosion of the tax base, which in turn brings about recurring problems in financing social security systems, such a fund could be financed by a better share of the profit generated by digitalisation. Avoiding an erosion of social cohesion stemming from digitalisation will undoubtedly constitute a major challenge for our societies of the 21st century.

Examples include driverless cars, online customer support or automatic speech recognition. Attackers could capitalise on the \u201cproliferation of drones\u201d and re-use them for \u201charmful ends\u201d, according to the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk , who helped put the report together.

Since its creation in 2015, Europe\u2019s military operation in the Mediterranean \u2014 named \u201cOperation Sophia\u201d \u2014 has saved some 49,000 people from the sea. But that was never really the main objective. The goal of the operation \u2014 which at its peak involved over a dozen sea and air assets from 27 EU countries, including ships, airplanes, drones and submarines \u2014 was to disrupt people-smuggling networks off the coast of Libya and, by extension, stem the tide of people crossing the sea to Europe. European leaders have hailed the operation as a successful joint effort to address the migration crisis that rocked the bloc starting in 2015, when a spike in arrivals overwhelmed border countries like Greece and Italy and sparked a political fight over who would be responsible for the new arrivals. But a collection of leaked documents from the European External Action Service, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy arm, obtained by POLITICO , paint a different picture. In internal memos, the operation\u2019s leaders admit Sophia\u2019s success has been limited by its own mandate \u2014 it can only operate in international waters, not in Libyan waters or on land, where smuggling networks operate \u2014 and it is underfunded, understaffed and underequipped. The confidential reports also show the EU is aware that a number of its policies have made the sea crossing more dangerous for migrants, and that it nonetheless chose to continue to pursue those strategies. Officials acknowledge internally that some members of the Libyan coast guard that the EU funds, equips and trains are collaborating with smuggling networks. For the operation\u2019s critics, the EU\u2019s willingness to turn a blind eye to these shortcomings \u2014 as well as serious human rights abuses by the Libyan coast guard and in the country\u2019s migrant detention centers \u2014 are symptomatic of what critics call the bloc\u2019s incoherent approach to managing migration and its desire to outsource the problem to non-EU countries. \u201cSophia is a military operation with a very political agenda,\u201d said Barbara Spinelli, an Italian MEP and member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in the European Parliament. \u201cIt has become an instrument of refoulement, legitimizing militias with criminal records, dressed up as coast guards.\u201d Now the operation, which is managed by Italy and has been dogged by political disagreements since it began, is coming under increasing pressure as the deadline for its renewal approaches in March. Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, far-right leader Matteo Salvini , has said the operation should only be extended if there are new provisions to resettle rescued people across the bloc. Last month, Germany announced it would be discontinuing its participation in the program , claiming that Italy\u2019s refusal to allow rescued migrants to disembark is undermining the mission. * * * Named after a baby girl born on an EU rescue ship, Sophia is the uneasy compromise to resolve a deep split across the bloc: between those who pushed for proactive search-and-rescue efforts to save more lives and those who favored pulling resources from the sea to make the crossing more dangerous. The naval operation sits uncomfortably between the two, rescuing migrants in distress at sea, but insisting its primary focus is to fight smugglers off the coast of Libya. The two activities are frequently in conflict. The operation has cycled through a number of strategies since its launch: a campaign to destroy boats used by smugglers; law-enforcement interviews with those rescued at sea; extensive aerial surveillance; and training and funding a newly consolidated Libyan coast guard. But the success of these approaches is highly disputed, and in some cases they have put migrants\u2019 lives at greater risk. The EU\u2019s policy of destroying the wooden boats used by smugglers to avoid them being reused, for example, has indeed disrupted the Libyan smuggling business, but at a substantial human cost. As Libyan smugglers lost their wooden boats, many started to rely more heavily on smaller, cheaper rubber boats. The boats, which smugglers often overfill to maximize profit, are not as safe as the wooden vessels and less likely to reach European shores. Instead, Libyan smugglers started to abandon migrants in international waters, leaving them to be pulled out of peril by European rescue ships. Sophia officials tracked the situation and were aware of the increased risk to migrants as a result of the policy. \u201cSmugglers can no longer recover smuggling vessels on the high seas, effectively rendering them a less economic option for the smuggling business and thereby hampering it,\u201d they wrote in a 2016 status report seen by POLITICO . The report acknowledged however that the policy has pushed migrants into using rubber boats, putting them in greater danger. \u201cEffectively, with the limited supply and the degree of overloading, the migrant vessels are [distress] cases from the moment they launch,\u201d it said. These overfilled rubber boats, which officials described as shipwrecks waiting to happen, also present a problem for the EU operation. International maritime law compels vessels to respond to people in distress at sea and bring the rescued to a nearby safe port. And because European courts have held that Libya has no safe port, that means bringing migrants found at sea to Europe \u2014 in most cases, Italy. This has exacerbated political tensions in the country, where far-right leader Salvini has responded to the influx of new arrivals by closing ports to NGO and humanitarian ships carrying migrants and threatening to bar Sophia vessels from docking. Meanwhile, Sophia officials have complained that rescuing people from leaking, unseaworthy boats detracted from the operation\u2019s ability to pursue its primary target: Libyan smugglers. In a leaked status report from 2017 , Sophia officials made a highly unusual suggestion: that the operation be granted permission to suspend its rescue responsibilities in order to focus on its anti-smuggling operations. \u201cConsideration should be given to an option that would allow the operation to be authorized for being temporarily exempt from search and rescue when actively conducting anti-smuggling operations against jackals in international waters,\u201d the report read. * * * The EU has also wilfully ignored inconvenient aspects of its policies when it comes to its collaboration with Libya\u2019s municipal coast guard. The intention of the strategy \u2014 launched one year into the Sophia operation \u2014 was to equip Libyan authorities to intercept migrant boats setting off from the Libyan coast and bring people back to shore. This saved Europe from sending its own ships close to coast, and meant that people could be brought back to Libya, rather than to Europe, as required by international maritime law \u2014 or more specifically, Italy. Here too, the EU was aware it was pursuing a problematic strategy, as the Libyan coast guard has a well-documented relationship with Libyan smugglers. A leaked report from Frontex , the EU\u2019s coast guard, noted in 2016: \u201cAs mentioned in previous reports, some members of Libya\u2019s local authorities are involved in smuggling activities.\u201d The report cited interviews with recently rescued people who said they were smuggled by Libyans in uniform. It also noted that similar conclusions were reported multiple times by the Italian coast guard and Operation Sophia. In Sophia\u2019s leaked status report from 2017, operation leaders noted that \u201cmigrant smuggling and human trafficking networks remain well ingrained\u201d throughout the region and that smugglers routinely \u201cpay off authorities\u201d for passage to international waters. \u201cMany of [the coast guard officers] were militia people \u2014 many of them fought with militias during the civil war,\u201d said Rabih Boualleg, who worked as a translator for Operation Sophia in late 2016 on board a Dutch ship involved in training the coast guard from Tripoli. \u201cThey were telling me that many of them hadn\u2019t gotten their government salaries in eight months. They told me, jokingly, that they were \u2018forced\u2019 to take money from smugglers sometimes.\u201d The coast guards talked openly about accepting money from smuggling networks in exchange for escorting rubber boats to international waters instead of turning them back toward the shore, Boualleg said. \u201cIf the [on-duty] coast guard came,\u201d Boualleg added, \u201cthey would just say they were fishermen following the rubber boats, that\u2019s all.\u201d Frontex\u2019s 2016 report documents similar cases. Two officials with close knowledge of Sophia\u2019s training of the Libyan coast guard also confirmed that members of the coast guard are involved in smuggling networks. A spokesperson for the Libyan coast guard did not return repeated requests for comment. EU governments have, for the most part, simply looked the other way. And that\u2019s unlikely to change, said a senior European official with close knowledge of Operation Sophia who spoke on condition of anonymity. For the first time since the start of the operation, Libyan authorities are returning more people to Libya than are arriving in Italy. \u201cEurope doesn\u2019t want to upset this balance,\u201d the official said. \u201cAny criticism of the coast guards could lead to resentment, to relaxing.\u201d Two years into the training program, leaked reports also show the Libyan coast guard was unable to manage search-and-rescue activities on its own. Sophia monitors their operations with GoPro cameras and through surveillance using ships, airplanes, drones and submarines. The operation is limited by its mandate, but it has made progress in difficult circumstances, an EEAS spokesperson said. Operation Sophia officials did not respond to multiple interview requests and declined to answer questions via email. \u201cThe provision of training the Libyan coast guard and navy, as well as continued engagement with them have proven to be the most effecting complementary tool to disrupt the activities of those involved in trafficking,\u201d the EEAS spokesperson said in an email. The spokesperson maintained that Libyan coast guards who are trained by Operation Sophia undergo a \u201cthorough vetting procedure.\u201d The spokesperson also stated that, while Operation Sophia does advise and monitor the Libyan coast guard, the operation is not involved \u201cin the decision-making in relation to operations.\u201d * * * With the March deadline for the operation\u2019s renewal fast approaching, pressure is mounting to find a way to reform Sophia or disband it altogether. When Salvini closed Italy\u2019s ports to NGO and humanitarian ships last July, the country\u2019s foreign minister turned to the EU to negotiate a solution that would ensure migrants rescued as part of Operation Sophia would be resettled among other countries. At the time, Italy said it expected results \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d Six months later, neither side has found a way through the impasse. \u201cThe fate of this operation is not determined yet,\u201d European Commissioner for Immigration Dimitris Avramopoulos told reporters last month, adding that discussions about allowing migrants to disembark in non-Italian ports are still underway among member countries. \u201cIf Italy decides \u2014 since it is the country in command of Operation Sophia \u2014 to stop it, it is up to Italy to make this decision.\u201d The political fight over the future of the operation has been made more acute by an increase in criticism from human rights organizations. Reports of violence, torture and extortion in Libyan detention centers have put the naval operation and EEAS on the defensive. A Human Rights Watch report published in January found that Europe\u2019s support for the Libyan coast guard has contributed to cases of arbitrary detention, and that people intercepted by Libyan authorities \u201cface inhuman and degrading conditions and the risk of torture, sexual violence, extortion, and forced labor.\u201d Amnesty International has also condemned the conditions under which migrants are being held, and in an open letter published earlier this month, 50 major aid organizations warned that \u201cEU leaders have allowed themselves to become complicit in the tragedy unfolding before their eyes.\u201d These human rights violations have been well documented. In 2016, the U.N. Human Rights Office said it considered \u201cmigrants to be at high risk of suffering serious human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, in Libya and thus urges States not to return, or facilitate the return of, persons to Libya.\u201d Last June, the U.N. sanctioned six men for smuggling and human rights violations, including the head of the coast guard in Zawiya, a city west of Tripoli. A number of officials under his command, a leaked EEAS report found, were trained by Operation Sophia. An EEAS spokesperson would not comment on the case of the Zawiya coast guards trained by Operation Sophia or how the officers were vetted. The spokesperson said that none of the coast guards \u201ctrained by Operation Sophia\u201d are on the U.N. sanctions list. The deteriorating human rights situation has prompted a growing chorus of critics to argue the EU\u2019s arrangement with Libya is unsustainable. \u201cReturning anyone to Libya is against international law,\u201d said Salah Margani, a former justice minister in Libya\u2019s post-civil war government. \u201cLibya is not a safe place. They will be subject to murder. They will be subjected to torture.\u201d \u201cThis is documented,\u201d Margani added. \u201cAnd [Europe] knows it.\u201d Sophia is also indicative of a larger, ineffective European policy toward Libya, said Tarek Megerisi, a Libya specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWhat does the EU do in Libya? They throw money at projects, but they don\u2019t have a very tangible operation on the ground. They really struggle to convert what they spend into political currency \u2014 Operation Sophia is all they\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. The project, he added, is less a practical attempt to stop smuggling or save migrants than a political effort to paper over differences within the EU when it comes to migration policy. With Sophia, he said, Europe is \u201cbeing as vague as possible so countries like Italy and Hungary can say this is our tool for stopping migration, and countries like Germany and Sweden can say we\u2019re saving lives.\u201d \u201cWith this operation, there\u2019s something for everyone,\u201d he said.

Marleen Stikker is the founder of the Dutch , and one of the Netherlands' pioneers in creating a digital society online in the early 1990s. A conversation with Stikker about technology quickly turns into one about language itself and the \"frames\" and \"narratives\" that are used. Take for example 'autonomous vehicle', or any 'autonomous' system. According to Stikker there is nothing 'autonomous' about those machines or algorithms, owned by private corporations. \"There is not a single autonomous system in the world. Nothing is autonomous. That is a totally fictitious idea,\" she told EUobserver in an interview. \"When the word 'autonomous' is used, that disguises that companies own the software,\" said Stikker. The immediate future of technology is often framed under the rhetoric of 'Will robots take over your job?' Stikker has a different take on this. \"No, a company takes over your job, through the robot. The companies pay and programme the robot,\" she said. Stikker said the argument that 'technology is neutral' does not hold the same way it does for, for example, a knife. \"You can do a lot of things with a knife, so it depends on the intention of the user whether they will cut bread or stab someone,\" she noted. \"But you cannot say that about software. Software carries out instructions, and those instructions have been preprogrammed,\" she added. Single market dominates Stikker has sat on several EU expert groups giving advice to the European Commission. Most recently, she has been appointed to an expert group on innovating cities. A recurring effort is to try to influence the narrative, to make sure the debate is not only about companies. \"The dominating narrative in the EU is that of the single market,\" said Stikker. She tries to supplement that by arguing that Europe is not only a 'market', but also a 'commons'. In an email exchange that took place after the interview, Stikker also emphasised that she was not against all companies. \"I differentiate between companies with an 'extractive' business model, which extract value without democratic supervision, and companies that are 'generative', retaining value, reciprocity and based on public values,\" she wrote. What helps is that the European commission itself, and more broadly the EU, is not a uniform being. \"There are also people within the commission that want a different approach,\" she said in the interview. Lobbying But it is difficult, she admits. \"The lobbying power is obviously on the side of industry. There is no way that in the short term we will be able to counter that with the same amount of lobbying power,\" said Stikker. This became apparent when EUobserver looked at how the commission developed its position on self-driving cars. While privately, commission civil servants would say that fully autonomous vehicles driving in European cities are still a long while away, the EU's official publications say otherwise - . Stikker disagrees that it is inevitable that self-driving cars will flood the streets of Europe. She dismissed the claim that autonomous cars will make fewer accidents than cars with human drivers. \"It is an assumption that if all cars are autonomous, we will have fewer accidents,\" she said. \"That is not a true statement, it is an assumption that cannot yet be falsified, because we do not have enough autonomous systems to falsify it,\" Stikker said, referring to Karl Popper's scientific concept of . \"We have no idea yet. No one can prove it - at best [you can show] simulations in which you have all the actors under control.\" Autistic cars This is one of Stikker's key reasons why society in the end will not choose to adopt fully self-driving cars - in order for them to work, the entire public space, including pedestrians, dogs, lampposts - would have to adapt so that the machine can 'see' them. Between drivers and pedestrians, there can be a dialogue. But that social dialogue is not possible in the same way with machines, explained Stikker, adding that autonomous systems by nature are \"autistic\" and \"narcissistic\". \"We would have to reduce ourselves to something the machine can understand,\" she said. Another argument against Europe embracing fully autonomous vehicles, is that the transition period is near-impossible to implement. \"Even if [the fully autonomous car] is [technically] possible, you would still have a transition period of 20 to 25 years during which you would have a mix of systems, where in some parts of the city there are smart sensors, but in others there aren't,\" she noted. From drivers to operators And then there is the challenge of the 'semi-autonomous' car, that is, one in which humans still have a role. \"When you are driving, you are in a flow,\" she said. But it is much more difficult for the human brain to suddenly take the wheel if you were not paying attention. \"Pilots and train drivers need long training to be able to act at the right moment,\" she said. A good driver does not necessarily make a good operator, said Stikker. \"Not everyone can do that,\" she noted. A switch to fully autonomous cars could maybe be foreseen in a totalitarian state, but not in a democracy. \"The complexity is too big for that. Fortunately. The world is not a computer model,\" said Stikker."}

Nicklas Lundblad, Google's vice-president in charge of government relations in Europe, is a member. So is Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer for Microsoft. Yet, what these senior employees of two of the US' biggest technology companies have actually told Mogherini is unknown. The European Union External Action Service (EEAS) \u2013 the EU's diplomatic service, which Mogherini heads \u2013 said in September that the panel was a new EU strategy on artificial intelligence (AI). The AI plan is scheduled to be unveiled on Friday (7 November). But documents released by the EEAS at the provide little concrete clues as to how the tech panel has contributed to the AI strategy. No minutes exist of the two meetings of the Global Tech Panel held so far. The EEAS released four letters Mogherini sent to the panel members - one before and one after each meeting. , written after the first meeting, said that Mogherini was \"ready to take the policy recommendations forward at my level in the EU\". However, it is unclear which policy recommendations were made. The letter has been heavily redacted. Similar redaction took place with a letter , sent by Mogherini after the panel's second meeting. \"I would like us to move forward [REDACTED] on artificial intelligence and lethal autonomous weapons systems,\" Mogherini wrote. EUobserver asked Mogherini's spokeswoman, Maja Kocijancic, to explain how the Global Tech Panel has \"fed into\" the EU's new AI strategy. \"The only way the Global Tech Panel has contributed is indirectly through the high representative/vice president [Mogherini], who may choose to take into account advice that she receives for internal use as part of her deliberations about forthcoming policy decisions,\" said Kocijancic. She did not say whether Mogherini has actually chosen to take some of the panel's advice into account, merely that she could. The EEAS accompanied the released documents with for the redactions and the lack of formal minutes. \"Some of the participants are leaders from important tech companies, the world of investment and civil society and their participation was premised on unconditional confidentiality,\" wrote the EEAS civil servant replying to the access to documents request. \"The public release of parts of these letters, which reveal the personal opinions of the participants, would therefore breach the confidentiality rule under which the Global Tech Panel meetings take place,\" he added. Ombudsman involved EUobserver has asked the European Ombudsman to investigate whether the EEAS was correct to decide not to produce any minutes, and whether the redactions were legitimate. The Ombudsman has that minutes of meetings should be made public for \"advisory groups that influence important policy areas\" - even if they are not formal expert groups. Another part of Mogherini's letter appears to hint that the tech panel influences policy areas. \"Politics needs technology to explore new opportunities and prevent potential threats, and technology needs diplomacy so that your expertise can shape good laws and diplomacy can help pave the way for progress,\" Mogherini wrote to panel members. The Global Tech Panel reportedly focuses on four themes: regulation of ; boosting digital jobs and skills; ethics of applied machine learning in surveillance, justice and security; and cyber security. No NGOs? Most of the 14 members work for technology corporations, including also DeepMind, Nokia, and Spotify. At the first meeting, John Frank replaced his Microsoft colleague Brad Smith. Frank is Microsoft's . In October, five MEPs from four political groups asked Mogherini to expand the group by inviting a representative of non-governmental organisation that is a member of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. They also asked her to include \"representatives of academia\", recommending someone from the International Panel on the Regulation of Autonomous Weapons (iPRAW). The panel already has Tom Fletcher, visiting professor at New York University Abu Dhabi, as its member. Fletcher that there was plenty of space at the two meetings he attended for the \"non-corporate\" view. \"I don't feel that we are being drowned out at all by the corporates,\" he said. The MEPs who asked for additional members did not receive a clear answer from Mogherini. that the panel would \"continue to build on the contributions from, inter alia, the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and iPRAW\", but neglected to answer whether she would invite new members to the tech panel. Spokeswoman Kocijancic also did not give a clear answer. \"The Global Tech Panel is not conceived as a closed group. For example, representatives of the United Nations were invited for the 25 September meeting in New York. The Global Tech Panel is open to new members, upon invitation by the High Representative,\" Kocijancic told EUobserver - evading the question about whether new members will be invited. Conflict of interest, or coincidence? Amel Karboul, another member of the Global Tech Panel, told EUobserver in a phone interview that the panel members who work for big tech companies did not use the panel to lobby on behalf of their corporations. Karboul, a professional speaker, former consultant and former minister of tourism in Tunisia, said the conversation behind closed-doors offered the opportunity for a \"safe space\" to talk. \"Putting people under the spotlight from day one may feel kind of uncomfortable,\" Karboul added, stressing the group does not have \"a decision-making or a formal role\". Nevertheless, in September that the panel's discussions had led to a \"concrete pilot project to link tech leaders, educators and governments to help build a 'digital generation' in Tunisia\". This raises a conflict of interest question, given that Karboul is a former member of the Tunisian government (2014-2015) and the panel has no other members that have ties to a country in the region - was it just a coincidence that of all the possible countries Tunisia was chosen? Karboul said the implementation of the project was in the hands of the EU, and said that objective criteria led to the decision for Tunisia. \"I'm originally from Tunisia but I didn't push for it,\" she said. \"I live in London and I have a global role at the moment. I don't live in Tunisia and I don't work for the Tunisian government,\" Karboul added. The EEAS spokeswoman said that the EU's delegation in Tunis was \"coordinating practical efforts in cooperation with the Global Tech Panel members themselves, based on their outreach to their respective contact networks\". There was no new budget assigned to the project. \"For the moment, the initiative is being taken forward within existing EU human and financial resources,\" she said. The EEAS spokeswoman said that no new meeting of the Global Tech Panel has been scheduled yet."}

But they can pose a threat to air traffic if they veer into airspace reserved for scheduled flights. What is being done to avoid dangerous close encounters? Koen Vrints is the owner of Friend Productions, a Belgian company that manufactures drones designed for the movie and television industry. He was testing his latest product in a public park in Antwerp when Euronews visited him. Detailed knowledge of the airspace is needed, given the proximity to the city\u2019s airport, Koen explained to Euronews. \u201cThe moment you take a course you get a lot of information on the airspace,\u201d said Vrints. \u201cWe get plans where we can see visually where locations are, where control zone from an airport is, where helicopter training area is and how we have to look at it on the plan.\u201d That importance of that information is growing: the billion euro drone market is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs. Belgian company Unifly which develops software designed to assist drone pilots navigate the varied and complex rules for drones. Its free smartphone app looks at where you want to fly and tells you whether the area is unrestricted, if special authorisation is required, or if drones are forbidden. \u201cWe know we\u2019re standing near an airport. And if you look at the system indeed, it tells me on the spot \u2018you cannot fly here,\u2019 because\u2026 I don\u2019t know yet why. I just click a bit further and it will tell me in detail why I\u2019m not allowed to fly here,\u201d explained Unifly\u2019s chief business development officer J\u00fcrgen Verstaen. With the latest apps, a virtual dome is mapped over the area where the drone is operated. It prevents it swerving into unauthorised airspace by creating a virtual wall. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a link between our software and the drone that informs him: watch out, the virtual wall is here, you cannot continue,\u201d Verstaen added. Air traffic regulators need to work fast to meet the demand from drones. \u201cThe biggest challenge we\u2019re facing is: on the one hand we\u2019ve a very conservative aviation community, where we take quite long years to make changes because we want to keep everything very safe; and now we\u2019ve a very innovative industry coming up who doesn\u2019t want to wait five to seven years, it wants to implement things now,\u201d said Mike Lissone, Unmanned Aircraft Expert, Eurocontrol (The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation). Regulations which vary from country to country need to be harmonised across Europe to keep scheduled passenger flights and drones operating safely , and without unnecessary complications."}

Tests show that the technology, known as RF-Pose, can reveal whether someone is walking, sitting, standing or even waving \u2014 and can identify individuals from a known group with a success rate of 83 percent. Its developers say it could prove useful for a range of applications, including law enforcement, search and rescue, and \u2014 perhaps most important \u2014 health care. Technology \"We've seen that monitoring patients' walking speed and ability to do basic activities on their own gives health care providers a window into their lives that they didn't have before, which could be meaningful for a whole range of diseases,\" Dina Katabi, a computer scientist at MIT and leader of the group, said in a statement . She and her colleagues presented new research about the technology last month at a computer vision conference in Salt Lake City. Katabi said doctors might use the technology to keep tabs on someone with Parkinson's disease by watching for changes in gait that might indicate a looming problem. Or people might use it to monitor an elderly relative \u2014 for example, to receive an instant alert if he or she falls. The technology, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret radio wave data, grows out of earlier work by the same group. Previous versions of the technology could detect a person's silhouette behind a wall, but Katabi said this is the first time it's been possible to closely track and identify people. The heart of RF-Pose is a laptop-sized radio transmitter. The radio waves it beams out pass through walls but are reflected by human bodies because of their high water content. Computer algorithms analyze the reflected waves, homing in on the head, hands, feet and other key body parts to produce moving stick figures on a screen. Katabi and her team trained RF-Pose by giving it photographs of people as well as the crude images created by the reflected radio waves. Eventually, RF-Posed learned to produce a stick figure whenever its radio signals indicated the presence of a person. What do other experts make of the new technology? Gin\u00e9s Hidalgo, a research associate at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, told NBC News MACH in an email that it was of limited use at this point because the radio signals it uses are unable to pass through thick walls. \"It could become a breakthrough\" if that limitation can be addressed, said Hidalgo, who was not involved in the project. But Hidalgo said the technology also raises privacy concerns. \"If a normal camera is recording me, it means I am able to see the camera, too,\" he said in the email. \"If this camera can be hidden behind or even inside any object, I would never be able to know when I am being monitored.\" Katabi acknowledged such concerns. \"Particularly in the current climate, this is an important question ,\" she told the news outlet Motherboard.\"We have developed mechanisms to block the use of the technology, and it anonymizes and encrypts the data.\" The researchers are working to test RF-Pose with the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and hope eventually to market a commercial version of the technology. WANT MORE STORIES ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?

This edition of Real Economy comes from the Spanish city of Valencia. As we move to urban economic powerhouses for jobs and opportunities we also have to deal with critical issues like economic hardships, such as housing, transport and pollution. And that is really forcing cities to start thinking of how to become smart cities. Around 80 percent of Europe\u2019s energy is used by us as city dwellers, but we contribute around 85 percent of the continent\u2019s GDP . Now as the world\u2019s urban population is set to double by 2050, it might be a good idea for us to understand what a smart city is. Crash course: smart city Everyday we connect life\u2019s dots, to wake up, go to work, socialise and sleep. Smart cities connect the dots as well. Between humans, society, information and communication technology. Connections that know when your next bus to work will arrive, and is capable of controlling the traffic to decrease congestion. Finding you a parking space. Sensors that light street lamps, call emergency services or warn about pollution levels in real time. Smart cities take all the elements of urban life, creating a technological platform that allows citizens, businesses and governments to communicate and work together. Smart cities have until recently been large ones like Barcelona or Amsterdam, but smaller cities are catching up, piloting or planning to implement smart city strategies. Leading the way in Europe with the largest number of these smart cities are the UK, Spain and Italy. Europe has put urban development at the heart of its plan for 2020. With a significant chunk of its European regional development fund earmarked to help smart cities, along with other funds that can be mixed and matched by cities and national governments. The logic? Well it is quite simple: that smaller cities after the crisis are going to have a tough time raising the cheap funding they need to do the infrastructure transformation a smart city requires \u2013 municipal budgets have been cut and debt levels tend to be quite high. Fanny Gauret set out to see how Valencia is starting its own smart transformation. Inspired by Europe\u2019s large smart cities, Valencia began its transformation in 2012. I\u2019m heading to the centre of urban innovation to find out how far they\u2019ve come. Tools like AppValencia allow locals get real time information on buses and bikes, alerts about the city, and even pay bills online. This is integrated into the smart city management platform \u2013 a first in Spain. \u201cIt is a horizontal platform, in the way that it integrates the information collated from all services and also the external information generated by companies,\u201d explained Rafael Monterde-Diaz, CEO , Las Naves Urban Innovation Centre, Valencia City Council. \u201cThe citizens are able to use the data. The private sector in general can develop apps, solutions that the city can benefit from, because it gives us a solution for a service, but also it is a viable business model that allow them to generate profitability.\u201d Valencia has budgeted over one billion euros for its transformation. More than half of that amount will be contributed by the European structural and investment funds . An example of how the change will help Valencia\u2019s residents is the traffic management control centre. Basically we have real time control of what is happening in the principal avenues of the city,\u201d added Monterde-Diaz. \u201cThe control of traffic lights, we can change the frequency to facilitate emergencies, for example, or avoid traffic jam.\u201d The system reduces pollution and can lower costs for utilities \u2013 so it\u2019s getting another six million euros from the Spanish government and the EU. Companies such as Telefonica are helping it happen. In the business world we have dedicated to themes around the Internet of Things, and amongst them, smart cities,\u201d Kim Faura, General Manager Catalonia, Valencian Community, Balearic Islands and Murcia Region, Telefonica Spain, told Euronews. \u201cWe have in our pocket a sensor that gives a lot of information. It is said that by 2020, millions of things will be connected.\u201d \u201cOur smart city strategy has allowed us to learn a lot about the resources we have in the city,\u201d said Monterde-Diaz. \u201cParking spots, street lamps, rubbish skips, they are in place, but now we need these objects to speak to us, and they\u2019ll communicate over the internet, allowing us to manage more efficiently.\u201d It is now up to Valencia to communicate and interact with the citizens, universities and companies to fully develop its strategy. Because that smart digitalization is critical to our booming urban population growth. Conversation with Ximo Puig, President of the Valencian government. A coherent strategy and building trust among citizens is imperative for a successful smart city. In a region like Valencia, that job falls on Ximo Puig . He is the president of the Valencian government. Maithreyi Seetharaman, Euronews: How are you building trust for a smart vision for Valencia and what is that vision? Ximo Puig: We came from a situation of mistrust in the public sector fundamentally because of problems from the past. It is still difficult but progressively results support the process and gradually there are more citizens, more companies that trust in this system of innovation that affects all of us and that most certainly is lead by the public sector together with the private sector. Maithreyi Seetharaman, Euronews: What is the state of Valencia\u2019s economy and how are you going to use technology to build on the strengths and curtail the weaknesses? Ximo Puig: The Valencian economy has grown 3.9 percent in the past year. Valencian companies and workers are overcoming great challenges We have a problem in adapting education to new companies and this is a fundamental element. We also have an issue with language skills. We have a problem with everything related to the incorporation of education into an innovative society. For example, The Valencian community will be the first community in Spain to be connected on line. This is a fundamental element to finally bringing all citizens, all families, all companies together into a real information society. Maithreyi Seetharaman, Euronews: How hard has it been for you to raise the money that you need from the capital markets or have you had to turn to grants and funding.. and in some ways do you think it sets some kind of precedent or example for other cities who are trying this strategy around Europe? Ximo Puig: We have to combine funds. Private funds like banks, companies and there is also the non-profit sector. There are diverse possibilities of capital contribution from the private sector but of course we need European funds, we also need our own funds. It is a process. We have the same problems as other different European regions. It is evident that there are more advanced regions and less advanced ones. In the end, this is about Europe having a project in favour of all of European regions facing this fundamental challenge which is an information society, a communication society. Maithreyi Seetharaman, Euronews: Mr. Puig, on that note thank you for your time."}

As part of this agreement, the EU has up to 6 months to reach an agreement on UK data adequacy for EU standards. However, Jones said that under current terms, the UK is able to diverge from EU rules, at its own will, despite having to request EU approval. \u201cThere are provisions in the bridging mechanism that recognize and permit the ability of the UK to make changes to its data protection law, or to exercise its new international data transfer powers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, subject to mutual agreement with the EU.\u201d Clubhouse under spotlight.

Around the policy conference circuits \u2013 all, of course, currently taking place online \u2013 we\u2019ve been given more of an insight into the next steps the European Commission will take when it presents a regulatory framework on Artificial Intelligence in the first quarter of this year. And indeed the inauguration of new US President Joe Biden hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed in this regard either. Speaking at an online event hosted by Forum Europe this week, Kim J\u00f8rgensen, head of cabinet of Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, said that now was the right time for the bloc to pursue a transatlantic accord on Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, J\u00f8rgensen also said the Commission would this year propose new rules on clarifying AI liability and would present a regulatory framework for high-risk Artificial Intelligence in March, as a follow up to the Artificial Intelligence White Paper presented in March. The outlines introduced by the Commission last year held back from putting forward strict safeguards against facial recognition technologies after an earlier leaked version of the paper floated the idea of a moratorium on facial recognition software. The Commission instead opted to \u201claunch an EU-wide debate on the use of remote biometric identification,\u201d of which facial recognition technologies are a part. Such a move was met with frustration by civil society groups, who had called for more stringent safeguards against certain technologies, including facial recognition applications, employed in public spaces. And questions do still remain in terms of how the Commission will balance the risks associated with the use of facial recognition technologies. The noises coming out this week from the European Parliament are somewhat hostile to the technology. A text led by Identity and Democracy MEP Gilles Lebreton, which was adopted by Parliament on Wednesday, called for the Commission to duly consider a moratorium on the software until all fundamental rights concerns have been taken into account. Earlier this week, Salla Saastamoinen, acting director-general for the Commission\u2019s DG Just was keen to highlight how the EU executive believes that current safeguards for the processing of biometric data laid out in the EU\u2019s general data protection regulation, would, in theory, be sufficient in safeguarding against the unethical use of facial recognition technology. But for their part, members of civil society are not satisfied with this approach.

Svenja Schulze currently serves as Germany\u2019s Minister for the Environment. She conducted this interview with EURACTIV\u2019s Samuel Stolton. You\u2019ve previously said you believe Europe\u2019s digital transition could help reach the bloc\u2019s climate goals for 2030 as part of the Green Deal. In what ways would you expect digital tools to be employed to help meet these targets? You\u2019ve previously said you believe Europe\u2019s digital transition could help reach the bloc\u2019s climate goals for 2030 as part of the Green Deal. In what ways would you expect digital tools to be employed to help meet these targets? Digital solutions are the key to bringing about the social and environmental transformation of our society. Digital management enables us to tap previously unimagined potential for efficiency, reduce resource consumption and achieve the climate goal of a CO2-free economy. Digital technology forms the basis for the energy transition and the mobility of tomorrow; just think of how traffic in cities can be reduced through smart management and linking sharing services with a strong public transport system. By collecting and analysing vast amounts of data, we are also harnessing the potential of AI for environmental protection and climate action. But we must act now. In the next few years, essential investment decisions will be made to achieve our climate goals. This period of profound change will be key, making it even more important not to set the wrong incentives in the recovery phase during and after the coronavirus pandemic. However, digitalisation does not necessarily lead to more sustainability, its ecological footprint is continuously growing and it can also increase existing problems. That is why we have to shape the digital transformation through policy. Early this year, the EU executive is due to present a so-called \u2018Digital Compass,\u2019 setting out the bloc\u2019s future ambitions in the digital arena for 2030. What should these objectives focus on, in your opinion? And how much should our green ambitions feature here? Early this year, the EU executive is due to present a so-called \u2018Digital Compass,\u2019 setting out the bloc\u2019s future ambitions in the digital arena for 2030. What should these objectives focus on, in your opinion? And how much should our green ambitions feature here? First of all, we cannot separate the digital transformation from sustainability issues, this is important. The two issues are closely intertwined, which is why the Green Deal calls it the \u201ctwin transition\u201d. Sustainability must become an underlying principle of digital policy, both at European and national level. With my Digital Policy Agenda for the Environment, which I presented last year, I formulated the clear political mandate to make digital innovations a tool for environmental protection and climate action and to firmly embed environmental and climate aspects in the regulation of digital technologies. Digitalisation may not be an end in itself; it must be put at the service of people and nature. Digital sovereignty is also repeatedly mentioned in the context of the Digital Compass. For me, part of this sovereignty is that we define and blaze our own, uniquely European digitalisation trail, which is based on our values. It revolves around data protection and reconciling different interests, around inclusion and sustainability. The European Green Deal and the General Data Protection Regulation are good first steps. Now it is also important to design policies such as the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the Data Governance Act in such a way that the future digital economy bears a clear European signature. Technology has often been criticised for its impact on the environment. For example, Germany has made much of the EU\u2019s plans to significantly build up its cloud services infrastructure, however, data centres are regarded as being particularly emission-intensive. In what ways can the damaging environmental effects of technology be mitigated? Since you asked specifically about data centres: of course, European data should stay in European hands as much as possible. If we think we need these cloud infrastructures, then it is up to us to provide them. This will allow us to maintain our digital sovereignty and make it easier to ensure that the cloud infrastructure is operated sustainably. Making digital technologies more climate-friendly is a multifaceted undertaking. For devices like smartphones, for example, the focus is mainly on raw material extraction, production and disposal, while the emphasis for digital infrastructures is more on energy consumption from ongoing operations. I n the case of data centres, inadequate capacity utilisation and cooling are areas that currently generate more emissions than necessary. At the moment, the market structure for data centres is still not at all transparent. In the long term, we need to enable consumers of computing power to distinguish between providers in terms of how green they are. Last year, during the German Council Presidency, the EU Commission was mandated for the first time to initiate measures for sustainable digitalisation. These included eco-design criteria, incentives for durable devices and climate-neutral data centres. And last but not least, we can\u2019t forget the data transmission networks. For instance, data transmission networks often consume more energy than data centres for one hour of online streaming. The general rule of thumb here is that cable-based data transmission is more efficient than mobile transmission.  Another area at the intersection of technology and the environment that has often been spoken about in Brussels has been how our devices are used and recycled. In a bid to reduce e-waste, the European Parliament has long supported the notion of introducing a \u2018right to repair.\u2019 What is your opinion of such plans? Another area at the intersection of technology and the environment that has often been spoken about in Brussels has been how our devices are used and recycled. In a bid to reduce e-waste, the European Parliament has long supported the notion of introducing a \u2018right to repair.\u2019 What is your opinion of such plans? We strongly support the Commission\u2019s plans for a Sustainable Products Initiative and consider it a good sign that Parliament is on the same page. The Sustainable Products Initiative aims to strengthen what is called the right to repair, i.e. to make it easier for consumers to repair a product instead of buying a new one. One aspect here is that products are designed to ensure that components can be easily taken apart, that manufacturers provide consumers with spare parts for a long period of time and at reasonable prices and that there is clear repair information. Another aspect is improving consumer rights, for example in terms of how long a claim can be made for a defect. A period of only 2 years to claim a defect under a guarantee is too short, especially in the case of products like household appliances. Manufacturers and retailers must be encouraged by clear rules to sell durable products \u2013 this is good for both the environment and for consumers. Talking of unnecessary electrical waste, research has shown that old mobile phone chargers generate more than 51 000 tonnes of electronic waste per year. According to recent reports, the Commission aims to present a legislative proposal for establishing a \u2018common charger\u2019 for devices in mid-July. However, the plans have long been derided by certain smartphone manufacturers, including Apple. What is your stance on this initiative? The fact that chargers are not standardised has certainly been a problem for resource conservation for a long time. Unfortunately, manufacturers have not yet found a solution voluntarily. I am therefore pleased that the Commission is now addressing this issue in the context of the Ecodesign Directive and looking at regulatory options. We are pushing for a) chargers to become standardised and thus interoperable and b) for retailers to sell smartphones and chargers separately, i.e. not together in one box. After all, if chargers are interoperable, households will no longer need a separate charger for each device. Incidentally, we do not just want interoperability within the product group of smartphones and tablets, but also for other well-suited products, such as digital cameras, portable speakers, e-readers, laptops etc. EU countries are currently outlining their spending plans as part of the bloc\u2019s Recovery and Resilience fund (RRF), 20% of which will be allocated to digital projects. As part of this outlay, the Commission is said to favour plans that will foster the green and digital transitions in parallel with one another. In your opinion, how likely is it that member states will see the value in this, and will there be a harmonised approach when it comes to their spending plans in this area?

In your opinion, how likely is it that member states will see the value in this, and will there be a harmonised approach when it comes to their spending plans in this area? During the German Council presidency in the second half of 2020, I received a lot of backing for putting the issue of digitalisation on the agenda together with environmental protection and climate action. The EU member states have clearly highlighted the importance of this \u201ctwin transition\u201d with the Council conclusions on \u201cDigitalisation for the benefit of the environment\u201d. An investment programme that links both aspects is therefore the logical next step. The EU and its member states need to provide adequate funding for key technologies such as AI, blockchain, the Internet of Things and high-performance computing now during these difficult times of tackling the pandemic. This is the only way we can meet our European environmental and climate goals, enable inclusive, socially just and sustainable economic growth and ensure an increase in competitiveness and prosperity. With the Council conclusions, the Commission is now called upon to propose specific measures for sustainable digitalisation. This is an enormous opportunity that makes me optimistic that we in the EU and in the individual member states will ambitiously pursue this issue. The EU\u2019s Justice Commissioner, Didier Reynders, has recently accused companies of \u2018greenwashing,\u2019 referring to the practice whereby companies claim to be doing more for the environment than they actually are. How serious an issue is this and what is the best way that such claims can be held to account? The EU\u2019s Justice Commissioner, Didier Reynders, has recently accused companies of \u2018greenwashing,\u2019 referring to the practice whereby companies claim to be doing more for the environment than they actually are. How serious an issue is this and what is the best way that such claims can be held to account? Sustainable corporate governance is growing in importance, the business community as a whole has recognised this trend and the public also has a greater awareness of sustainable business. As a result, many companies already publish sustainability reports today. However, they vary considerably in scope and quality. This is where the EU Commission comes in because people have a right to reliable information. Justice Commissioner Reynders\u2019 statement shows that the current legal framework for sustainable corporate governance and transparent sustainability reporting is not yet sufficient. In many product categories, such as organic or fair trade, there are established labels that make our everyday consumer choices much easier. I think that we need an overall set of rules for sustainable corporate governance and complementary standards and labels for the environmental performance of products and companies. The label \u201cclimate- or CO2-neutral\u201d often stands for very different things. The term greenwashing no longer applies if two conditions are met: emissions offsetting must be embedded in a mitigation strategy. When a carbon credit is issued, there must be exactly one additional mitigation measure that is clearly attributed to this credit. In the long term, all companies will have to produce without emitting any CO2, and it is only fair that true pioneers should also have a competitive advantage or at least not be placed at a disadvantage.

Every European country with an arms industry worthy of the name sells its wares to whoever is willing to pay. Consequently, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s statement that his government \u201cwill not condition matters of defence and economic cooperation\u201d on the human rights record of Egypt\u2019s leader Abdel Fattah el Sisi, after the two leaders held talks in the Elysee Palace this week, should have been no surprise to anyone. \u201cIt is more effective to have a policy of demanding dialogue than a boycott which would only reduce the effectiveness of one our partners in the fight against terrorism,\u201d Macron added in justification, presenting el Sisi a list of political detainees who should be released. We can only wish him good luck with that. No one would suggest that France is alone among European governments in arming dictators \u2013 for it is a pretence to suggest that el Sisi is anything else \u2013 but Macron\u2019s remarks have more than a whiff of hypocrisy about them this week At their pre-Christmas summit on Thursday and Friday, EU leaders will be under pressure, principally from France, Greece and Cyprus, to slap sanctions on Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkish government. The charge sheet facing Erdo\u011fan is long: aggression in the Eastern Mediterranean, repeated violation of Greece and Cyprus\u2019 maritime zones, not to mention providing arms and air force support for one side \u2013 albeit the UN-backed government \u2013 in the Libyan civil war. In all likelihood, sanctions of some form will be imposed. But, apart from drilling in EU waters in the Mediterranean, what is Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey doing that is different to el Sisi\u2019s Egypt? Like Turkey, Egypt wants to be a regional player. Both states have interfered in the Libyan civil war by providing weapons and, in some cases, troops. Neither state can be called a democracy though, ironically, el Sisi\u2019s regime is actually more oppressive when it comes to a free press, allowing opposition parties to exist and function and other civic freedoms. The main difference is that, purely because of realpolitik , Egypt is Turkey\u2019s regional rival and, therefore, a French strategic ally. Brazen hypocrisy is never a good look. Nor, in the long-run, does it tend to help leaders like Macron to persuade others to support them. If the EU\u2019s foreign and defence policy cannot be described as \u2018ethical\u2019 as such \u2013 though the bloc would like to think so in the case of its sanctions against Belarus, Russia and elsewhere \u2013 there is little chance of unanimous agreement across the EU27 when leaders are so blatantly pursuing there own narrow national interests.

Vestager\u2019s position puts her at odds with Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, who has recently been quoted as saying he would like to keep the option of \u2018structural separations\u2019 of the Big Tech giants on the table, under certain conditions.

The Executive has, however, never chosen to put such powers into practice. Meanwhile, Germany weighed into the debate this week, with Armin Jungbluth of the German Economy Ministry saying that his country would be \u2018reluctant\u2019 to advocate for a Big Tech breakup \u2013 a position backed by France.

Data Governance Act. The European Commission has decided against imposing geographical restrictions on the establishment of so-called \u201cdata sharing services\u201d as part of ambitious new plans laid out in the landmark Data Governance Act, presented on Wednesday. As a means to facilitate greater sharing of non-personal and industrial data across the bloc, the European Commission believes such data-sharing processes should be set up as a means to act as a go-between for exchanges between data producers and acquirers. Previous drafts of the new regulation, which was finally published on Wednesday (25 November), had laid down the obligation that new data sharing services acting as intermediaries between data holders and secondary users would have to be established in the EU. Yet the final version stipulated that any such data sharing services should either have a place of establishment in the EU or at least \u201cdesignate a representative\u201d in Europe. Moreover, while the Commission seems to have watered down previous attempts at ringfencing European industrial data to the bloc, Wednesday\u2019s text still establishes requirements for transfers to third countries.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday (25 November), Breton noted how online platforms would be assessed against criteria including their impact on the EU\u2019s single market, whether such services are \u2018unavoidable\u2019 for smaller players in the ecosystem, and whether or not such platforms occupy a dominant position in the market so as to be in a position to \u2018kill off\u2019 competition.

{"_id": "227715390929_10158603818745930", "content": "Europe should still aim at attracting more than \u20ac20bn of investment annually in artificial intelligence (AI) over the next decade, despite the difficult economic outlook that the coronavirus pandemic represents, EU commissioner for the digital age, Margrethe Vestager, said on Tuesday (27 October). \"We definitely should not give up this target. We need to increase it if we want Europe to be a leader in enabling trustworthy AI,\" Vestager told MEPs from the European Parliament's new committee on AI. \"It is tricky to exactly evaluate the effect of the pandemic, but we need to push and make the best possible use of limited public funds in order for private funds to be invested [in the EU's AI projects],\" she added. EU leaders previously agreed that at least 20 percent of the recovery fund would be made available for the digital transition, including for AI investments. But higher investment levels are needed in order to compete with the US and China. From Google translate to self-driving cars, AI is expected to witness huge growth in the next years - and some experts suggest that the pandemic will only accelerate the deployment of more AI-based solutions across the globe. Earlier this year, the commission unveiled which is mainly based on establishing new binding requirements for the development and use of \"high-risk\" applications - considering whether both the sector and the intended use involve a potential risk for citizens when it comes to safety or fundamental rights. However, Vestager said that the EU executive is considering focussing only on the risk of \"concrete uses\" of these technologies since the public consultation revealed that there is a generalised concern about the sectoral approach. \"We say that if this is what the technology is to be used for, then you need to adhere to certain requirements. But only when we find that something fundamental is at stake we will ask data to be accounted for or the algorithm to be explained,\" Vestager said, adding that these requirements will also create trust in these technologies. Moreover, the commission also wants to be able to update the list of \"high-risk\" use-cases as new products might pose risks that today might seem unthinkable. Speaking about facial recognition, the commissioner said that the bloc's rules for personal data (GDPR) are already on the use of this technology in public spaces since their use must be proportional and necessary under national legislation. \"These are some of the things that in contrast to other countries where you see that facial recognition and other technologies are used for the surveillance of citizens,\" she said. Meanwhile, Vestager called on the members of the parliament's new AI committee to discuss the bloc's long-term priorities in this field, as well as the numerous sectoral policies of the EU that will have to be adopted. \"If we make the best use of technology what are the things that we should aim for in 2030? This is not only a technical manoeuvre. It is about what kind of society we want to be when we are fully digitalised,\" she told MEPs. Last week, MEPs adopted three reports that set the priorities of the parliament to regulate AI in terms of ethical standards, civil liability and intellectual property rights.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "EU Commission sticks to \u20ac20bn AI target, despite Covid"}
{"_id": "227715390929_10158795766760930", "content": "Amid frustration around the sluggish roll-out of vaccines and fears over the new Covid-19 mutants in Europe, EU leaders are holding a videoconference on Thursday (21 January) to discuss ways to speed up inoculating their citizens. Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen and Finnish premier Sanna Marin both wrote to EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen last week. They urged the EU executive to make good on the bloc's early investment in pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines and ramp up production and shipments to member states. \"We as the member states and our citizens, expect faster and more efficient action,\" Marin wrote in a letter. Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban has meanwhile piled pressure on his country's health authority to decide on approving Covid-19 vaccines from China, saying western versions negotiated by the EU were too slow to arrive, Bloomberg reported. EU leaders have been holding regular videoconferences during the pandemic, but the perceived slow vaccination roll-out has given extra weight to this meeting. MEPs on Tuesday (19 January) in a debate on vaccines will call again for more clarity and transparency regarding vaccine contracts, authorisation, availability and deployment of Covid-19 vaccines. So far MEPs have access to only one contract, with CuraVac, whose vaccine is not yet approved by the EU regulator - because it is the only company that agreed to have the contract be reviewed by lawmakers. Portuguese questions On Wednesday (20 January), US president-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated in Washington amid unprecedented security measures following the storming of the US Capitol by militant loyalists of Donald Trump, in which five people died. On the same day, MEPs will debate the future of EU-US relations, which the EU is hoping can be reset after Trump's \"America first\" policy. On Wednesday morning, MEPs will discuss with Portugal's prime minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa and von der Leyen the programme of the Portuguese EU presidency, which hopes to put social issues in the centre of the economic crisis management. In the afternoon, MEPs will turn their attention to the concerns over the lack of transparency surrounding the appointment of the Portuguese prosecutor to the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO), which lawmakers worry could undermine the EU prosector's office. Disconnect MEPs are set to call in a resolution on Thursday for an EU law granting workers the right to disconnect digitally from work without facing consequences from employers. They consider the right to disconnect a fundamental right that allows workers to refrain from engaging in work-related tasks and phone calls, emails and other electronic messages outside their working hours. MEPs will also debate and vote on Thursday on three resolutions proposing measures to enhance gender equality, better protection for women's rights especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, and tackle the digital gender pay gap. EU legislators will insist in a resolution on the respect for human-rights principles and meaningful human control in the use and development of AI and to warn of threats to fundamental human rights and national sovereignty because of its use in mass surveillance. On Thursday, MEPs will debate and vote on a text condemning the Chinese crackdown on the democratic opposition in Hong Kong.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "EU leaders seek to speed up vaccinations This WEEK"}

The advantages offered by progress in image-recognition and machine learning can notably increase military operational capacities - ranging from optimisation of logistics to autonomous weapons systems that can identify and attack a target with no human intervention. The study, commissioned by The Left in the European Parliament, reveals the role that AI plays in the bloc's defence strategy, described by Marischka as a hype \"propagated by industry and (venture) capital to mobilise public funds for their profits\". The European Commission approved last June , which will benefit from \u20ac205m EU financing. These include algorithms to handle swarms of drones, airborne electronic attack capabilities, unmanned ground vehicles, high-precision missiles and cybersecurity reinforcement. \"The EU's armament policy means unmanned and autonomous systems will be used in large numbers and often in swarms on land, air, sea, space and cyber in the future,\" said Marischka, arguing that actively promoting these developments \"will change the nature of war and people's daily lives, increasingly blurring the distinction between conflict and peace\". Ahead of the commission's legislative proposal on AI, expected in early 2021, leftwing MEPs have urged a stop to this \"arms race,\" calling on the EU executive to regulate or even on autonomous weapon-systems and cyberwar. \"The escalation in armament does not just mean swarms of drones and killer robots, but it threatens to undo the difference between war and peace, civilians and combatants. The risk of a gradual loss of control is real. International law will then become meaningless,\" warned German MEP \u00d6zlem Alev Demirel. \"What sounds like science fiction could become a reality very soon, that is why we need to be extremely critical,\" she added. Meanwhile, more than 60 civil society and rights groups have to establish \"appropriate limitations on the use of AI-based technologies\" to ensure that their uses are safe, legal, and do not discriminate.

{"_id": "227715390929_10158690936555930", "content": "In the coming days the European Commission seems poised to green-light the acquisition of Fitbit by Google. The deal is a major threat to human rights and must be stopped in its tracks until a full and proper investigation into the human rights impact of the merger takes place. Anything less will send a clear green-light to Silicon Valley - and to billions of Internet users - that, for all its , the EU is happy with 'business-as usual' - no matter what the costs are to people's rights. The EU's own auditor recently criticised the commission for being too slow to rein in Big Tech. With the imminent decision on the Fitbit takeover, the commission has an opportunity to show that this time it is prepared to act before it's too late. Google's acquisition of Fitbit would give the company access to a vast new dataset containing the intimate, biometric data of almost 30 million people. It raises alarm bells that this data could be cross-matched with the gargantuan amount of data that Google already has about its users from its dominance across a whole range of services (Search, Ads, Android, Gmail, YouTube, Pay and Maps to name a few). The scale of the data Google holds means that you don't have to be a Fitbit user to feel concerned about what the deal will mean for you. It's enough for Google to obtain biometric data from someone statistically similar to you for the company to be able to infer things about your health and lifestyle that you would never otherwise permit them to know. Google already creates highly-personalised 'superprofiles' in order to predict behaviour and target advertisements at users. Adding biometric data to the mix would allow it to make even more invasive predictions about people \u2013 based on insights about their very biology. This kind of data is a gold mine to a company that has its sights set on the health sector. \"Health Tech\" is already a $100bn [\u20ac82.4bn] business and one that is projected to rise substantially in the coming years. Big Pharma, life insurance companies and a broad range of are all jostling for health-data insights to make predictions about people and infer risk. Fitbit's CEO knew this was his company's value when he said, Surveillance capitalism These are the mechanics of at work \u2013 the fact that Google's business model was designed from the get-go to mine, profile and influence people at scale by capturing their data \u2013 and attention \u2013 and selling it to others. Last year, that this \"surveillance-based business model\" poses an unprecedented threat to human rights by forcing people to make a Faustian bargain: give up their intimate data \u2013 and their rights \u2013 in order to participate in today's digital world. This is simply not a legitimate choice and invalidates the so-called 'consent' that Google relies on to justify its invasive data practices. The Google-Fitbit merger is set to compound this problem. We have already seen that AI-driven insights can be used to target people based on sensitive personal information, including inferences about their health status. Such data is also being used to inform sensitive decisions about who can access or , and at what cost. Sleep patterns and heartbeat Fitbit would give Google access to granular detail about millions of people's sleeping patterns, heart rate, fitness levels and movements, allowing them to make even more . While this is undoubtedly a data-protection issue, it is also squarely a competition problem. When a single company provides near-ubiquitous digital services to two billion people, meaningful choice to the consumer no longer exists. Google's sheer size and power mean that people have no control in how their data is used or how they are targeted by Google's advertising apparatus (whether or not they use Google services themselves). At the same time, the fact that the company has a monopoly on so much data, means that it is uniquely positioned to leverage the insights it can glean from existing parts of its business to further entrench its reach and dominance in other areas (such as health tech). Google has told the EU commission that it could undertake not to use any Fitbit data for advertising purposes for a period of five years, something which the as a possible remedy. Yet, green-lighting the merger on this basis - with the looming risk that this data will be combined down the line - would be irresponsible and naive. Google pledged to do the same when it acquired DoubleClick in 2008 but has since Facebook made similar public assurances when it acquired WhatsApp in 2014, only to change its privacy policy two years later to allow data sharing between the services, including for ad-targeting. While companies are happy to make such commitments upfront, they bank on the fact not much can be done when they later change course. In the past few years, people worldwide have woken up to the perils of Big Tech and the havoc that the surveillance-based business model has wrought not just on individual rights but on society writ-large. A poll by Amnesty International of people in nine countries showed that nearly believe the central business model underpinning the internet today is a major problem with a clear majority wanting governments to do more to rein in Big Tech. With the EU's new Digital Service Act still some way off being agreed, let alone implemented, the commission's competition authority is even more critical as a safeguard to protect people's rights. If it permits Google/Fitbit to go ahead now, without proper attention to the possible human rights impacts, we will be living with the consequences for decades to come.", "source_name": "EUobserver", "title": "Google, Fitbit, and a big decision for EU Commission"}
{"_id": "101402598109_10158568414208110", "content": "As coronavirus ripped through the world last year one American company saw it happening in the United States almost three weeks before Covid-19 cases were officially announced. For the last nine years, Kinsa Health has been tracking fevers from its network of millions of smart-phone-connected thermometers. The technology and early warning system could improve how we control infectious diseases before they spiral into pandemics. During the onset of Covid-19 in March 2020, the company took their forecasts of body temperatures of previous years and subtracted the typical cold and flu numbers. The results were surprising and worrisome. \u201cWhat we were seeing in March was an unusual outbreak everywhere, a complete black swan event,\u201d Kinsa founder and CEO Indra Singh told Euronews. \"We were really worried that there was Covid-19 everywhere,\" he explained. Kinsa reviewed the data showing hot spots lighting up in Texas and Florida. But Singh was told his results were not credible, because at that time coronavirus cases were only confirmed in Seattle and Santa Clara county in California. But 18 days later, coronavirus cases were confirmed in Texas and Florida. At the time Singh could tell that it was an unusual outbreak, but could not confirm it was Covid-19 until he had completed two month of further investigation. Could smart thermometers prevent future pandemics? Healthcare systems carried out the traditional measures to control the virus: widespread testing, treating and isolating and vaccinating. But early warning should be the first step. \u201cBy the time someone enters the health care system, by the time they see a doctor get a test, it's too late, they have already spread that illness,\u201d said Singh. But, he argues, if there was an early warning system we could have the opportunity to \u201cget ahead and to contain outbreaks before they spread to the broader population\u201d. Kinsa is now using its data to help US efforts to contain coronavirus and its data is used by officials in five states and five cities, as well as by research groups. To date, it has distributed around 2.4 million thermometers in the US. With prices starting at $24,99 (20,99 euros) it is an affordable product for many, and is also used by top athletes. The National Basketball Association (NBA) uses Kinsa\u2019s thermometers for its players and coaches to protect themselves from coronavirus. The company is trying to expand its network and will be available in the United Kingdom this summer, and in other European countries within the next year. Rolling out the smart thermometers to poor communities is the priority, Singh said, as they do not have access to health care. One in four of Kinsa\u2019s products are given away for free to the underserved, something he says will help the company to identify the epidemic early. In 2013, Kinsa launched its FLUency Program, which was initially to help schools combat the seasonal flu. The company relies on government grants and donations to get the smart thermometers to underprivileged communities for free. It is now used in 5% of US primary schools. More than a thermometer Kinsa\u2019s product does not just take your temperature. The app asks you a series of questions about your symptoms and can help make your decision if you should see a doctor, seek emergency aid or stay at home. \u201cKids get sick so frequently and I know that the first thing that occurs in parents' minds is the 'what's going around?' question,\u201d said Singh. \u201cAnd if I know that what's going around is something more severe, if it's flu versus the common cold, well, I'm like more likely to go and stay home, treat them, get them to the doctor.\u201d Telemedicine is here to stay Managing and tracking our health through technology has accelerated due to the coronavirus pandemic, as access to care has become more complicated due to restrictions. \"Telemedicine was a big trend even before a pandemic but the way Covid-19 has impacted the adoption of digital health technologies is that it's creating a new a new norm,\u201d say Bartalan Mesk\u00f3, the expert who brands himself The Medical Futurist . With technology like Kinsa's as well as other companies such as Withings launching smartwatches that can measure your blood oxygen levels and even record an electrocardiogramme at the touch of a button, it has become easier to manage our health. But while digitisation allows us to better understand our bodies, the key is sharing that information with the experts. \u201cIn the way we have to become experts about our own lifestyle or health and disease management, but not to diagnose ourselves alone, but to share that data with a partner physician with their expertise in medicine and health care,\u201d Mesko said. \u201cWe together as a medical team, we can get to the best medical decisions for my medical issues.\u201d The question now is whether this pandemic is the moment to make the cultural shift in healthcare needed to take advantage of the technological revolution that digitisation and digitalisation can offer.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "How a smart thermometer saw Covid-19 coming before the experts"}

The demonstrations came on the day when restaurants and cafes were forced to close early, and cinemas, gyms and other leisure venues were closed altogether. The new measures are the government's response to soaring COVID-19 infections which have brought fears that hospitals may become overwhelmed. Violence clouds peaceful protests In the northern city of Turin, some demonstrators broke off from a peaceful protest, smashing store windows on an elegant shopping street, setting smoke bombs and hurling bottles at police in a main city square where the Piedmont regional government is headquartered, RAI state TV said. A photographer was injured by a hurled bottle, RAI said. Police fired tear gas to clear the protesters in Piazza del Castello. Several people were reportedly arrested. In that same square, hours earlier, some 300 taxis peacefully lined up in neat rows to draw attention to their economic losses from the implosion of tourism and disappearance of workers from the city centre as they do their jobs remotely during the pandemic. In Italy's business capital, Milan, police used tear gas to scatter protesters Monday night, and an Associated Press journalist saw at least two people detained. Trams were vandalised, bins set on fire, scooters overturned and some windows smashed. Bottles and smoke bombs were hurled at security forces who responded with tear gas. In the south, clashes were also reported between groups of youths and police in Naples, where thousands of people called for the resignation of the head of the Campania region. Economic woes Smaller cities, including Catania in Sicily, and towns also saw protests Monday. In Cremona, a town in northern Lombardy, restaurant owners turned out in front of the local interior ministry's office. After banging pots and bans, they left them piled up in the street to highlight their economic woes worsened by the latest early-shutdown decree, the ANSA news agency said. The protests began shortly after the national government's order took effect requiring bars, cafes and restaurants to close their doors at 6 p.m. for the next 30 days as Italy tries to rein the resurgence of coronavirus infections in recent weeks. Since most Italians don't dine out before 7:30 p.m. at the earliest, the decree effectively wiped out most of the restaurants' already reduced revenue in the pandemic, although takeout and delivery can continue until midnight. The restrictions also require high schools to move to at least 75% distance learning while younger children remain in classrooms. Indoor and outdoor gatherings including for religious reasons are banned. The government also strongly recommends people avoid having house guests and travelling in the country except for work, health or other necessities. Extremist groups implicated Triggering the violence in Turin were a group of \u201cultras,\u201d as violent soccer fans are known, the LaPresse news agency said. It said five of the protesters were detained by authorities. Last week, a peaceful march by shopkeepers and other business owners in Naples, upset about a regional curfew that orders citizens off the streets at 11 p.m., turned violent near the Campania region's headquarters. Investigators were quoted in Italian media as saying the violence, in which police officers were injured, bore the hand of the Camorra, the local organized crime group. A day later, an extreme right political group staged a violent demonstration in downtown Rome. Far-right politicians have slammed the restrictions. But the political left and the government have accused the right of surfing on popular discontent. \"Don't forget that the real enemy is the virus,\" Italy's President Sergio Mattarella said on Monday. People urged to 'take responsibility' The Italian crackdown was announced on Sunday, a day after the country registered more than a half-million confirmed COVID-19 cases since the pandemic's outbreak. Italy has been registering around 20,000 new confirmed infections per day and health authorities have warned that some hospital COVID-19 wards risk hitting the saturation point in the next week or two. Europe's confirmed death toll from coronavirus has topped 250,000 according to the US Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said national lockdowns can be avoided, urging countries to use other methods to stop virus transmission, including boosting surveillance, testing and contact tracing. A senior WHO official said on Monday that people should take personal responsibility for everyday decisions, such as whether to visit crowded places, avoiding closed environments and postponing social gatherings.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "Coronavirus: Protests in Italy over new pandemic crackdown turn violent"}
{"_id": "101402598109_10158276611808110", "content": "As many as 62 police officers were injured and 81 people were arrested at so-called \"freedom marches\" across France on Saturday, according to the country's Interior Ministry. Demonstrations took place throughout the country against a controversial new bill that would ban police images and increase surveillance. The ministry said 23 of the arrests took place in Paris and the other 39 in other locations. Several videos published on social networks appeared to show police officers being beaten by demonstrators at the events. Two people that took part in protests that were not in the capital reported they had been injured to the General Inspectorate of Police (IGPN), police said. Syrian freelance photographer, Ameer al Halbi, 24, who was covering the demonstration was injured in on his face, according to AFP. Reporters Without Borders' secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, denounced what he said was \"unacceptable police violence\" against Halbi. A total of 133,000 people, 46,000 of them in Paris, took part in the protests, according to the Interior Ministry. Organisers put the figure at 500,000, with 200,000 of them in the capital. What were demonstrators speaking out against? The French parliament is currently examining article 24 of the National Security bill, which proposes criminalising the filming and publication of images of on-duty police officers. Media groups in France say it could impact journalists covering police operations, while other critics fear it's intended to dissuade citizens from holding the police accountable. The organisers of the protests claim 500,000 took to streets throughout France, reporting 200,000 demonstrators in the capital Paris alone. The StopLawSecurityGlobal coordination, which includes journalists' unions and human rights groups, also denounced violent scenes that it said took place in Paris and Lyon after the end of the demonstration. The protests came after video images of three police officers beating a black music producer inside his studio in Paris went viral this week, causing an outcry that saw politicians, footballers and millions of social media users express their disgust. But supporters of the law, above all Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, say it is necessary to protect the identity of law enforcement officers who are at risk of harassment, threats and violence. On Thursday, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the government would review the wording of the draft law following the new scandal over police brutality. In Paris, thousands gathered in the Place de la Republique carrying flags and banners that denounced police violence, demanded media freedom and called for the Interior Minister's resignation. There were some scuffles between protesters and police in the surrounding streets. Thousands turn out in Nantes Police said around 3,500 people took to the streets of the French city of Nantes on Friday night to demonstrate. Joint trade unions say the figure was between 6,00-7,000. Demonstrators carried banners and placards reading \"defence of individual and collective freedoms,\" \"no to the proposal for a comprehensive security law,\" and \"violence, the last refuge of incompetence,\" as well as \"not seen, not taken.\" The march began calmly, but scuffles broke out for an hour and a half from around 7:30 pm when police used tear gas to dispersed the crowd. \"I am not criticizing all the police officers, of course, we need a respectable police force, we need a trusted police force, but they have to clean up,\" explained Camille, a 56-year-old demonstrator from Nantes. \"I am very angry,\" he added. \"To all the police officers who are doing their job correctly, I wish them good luck in this police force, which is drifting towards unacceptable things.\" Among the slogans chanted were: \"Liberty, liberty, liberty,\" and \"police everywhere, justice nowhere,\" as well as \"everyone hates the police.\" Officers said they arrested 17 people, including six before 5.30 pm when the police asked protesters to open their bags when they arrived at the assembly point. \"Justice must quickly shed light on this police violence,\" tweeted the mayor of Nantes Johanna Rolland, in reaction to the images of the beatings of the music producer in Paris. \"It is also urgent to create an independent control and sanction authority, in place of the IGPN (General Inspectorate of the National Police),\" said Rolland. In the face of criticism, the government added an amendment to the bill, specifying it \"will only target images aimed at harming officers' physical or psychological integrity.\" After clearing the lower house, the draft security law will now need to be approved by the Senate. Some experts believe it could also face censure from France's constitutional court.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "France security bill: 62 police officers injured and 81 arrested at nationwide protests"}
{"_id": "101402598109_10158570416928110", "content": "The coronavirus pandemic has been at the forefront of the health agenda for more than a year but another epidemic has been starring us in the face for several decades and is arguably an even bigger worry: diabetes. The World Health Organization estimates it affects 422 million (1 in 11 adults) worldwide, which compared to coronavirus infections, diabetes affects three times as many people. The figure for people living with diabetes is expected to rise to 700 million worldwide by 2045. Diabetes \u201cis already a full-blown epidemic of such dynamics that the number of people with diabetes has almost quadrupled in the last 30 years\u201d, Dr Gojka Roglic, the medical officer for diabetes management at the World Health Organization told Euronews. The chronic disease has entered the WHO's top 10 causes of death, following a significant percentage increase of 70% since 2000. The non-communicable disease not only increases the risk of premature death, but can also cause strokes, blindness, heart attacks, kidney failure and amputation. A complex disease It is well known that diet and lifestyle can play a huge role in Type 2 diabetes but the disease is much more complex. For starters, there are 14 types of diabetes, which occurs when the body\u2019s ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin is impaired. Type 1 and type 2 are the most common and there is also gestational diabetes, which can develop briefly during pregnancy. Type 1 is an auto-immune condition where the body cannot produce enough insulin and often affects children. The reasons why it develops are not fully understood. Type 2 diabetes is where the body can produce insulin but cannot use it well. It develops with age and can be caused by genetics and lifestyle. This type is responsible for 90% of diabetes cases but there are solutions to control it. The main risk factors for type 2 are aging, obesity and physical inactivity, Dr Roglic said, but she stressed \u201cthese risk factors are not easy to tackle or to control\u2026because despite being conceptually simple, they're not easy to implement.\u201d But she said there is a lot governments can do such as how they plan cities, education, transport and food policies, such as sugar taxes. On April 14, the same day insulin was discovered 100 years ago, the WHO will roll out a diabetes agenda called the Global Diabetes Compact, which will support countries in implementing programmes, focus on reducing obesity and aims to improve access to medicines and technologies, particularly to low and middle-income countries. Raising awareness is key as many people do not know they have diabetes until it is too late. \u201cWe have like an iceberg of diabetes floating in Europe, we have this big under the water group that who don't know they have it,\u201d Professor Chantal Mathieu, chair of the European Diabetes Forum told Euronews. In Europe, 60 million adults have diabetes (1 in 10 Europeans), which is set to increase to 69 million by 2045. Professor Mathieu said as diabetes can present no symptoms in the beginning, many people only seek treatment when they have already destroyed their kidneys and need dialysis. \u201cWe need to move from a reactive approach, where you react when all the damage is done, to a proactive approach,\u201d she said. To do so, she said improved data collection and sharing, better access to health care, advising policy makers and novel technologies are needed. Innovative tech solutions Diabetes is invasive to your everyday life. It demands you treat yourself with pills or insulin and you need to monitor your glucose levels and blood pressure. Traditionally, this involves pricking your finger daily, which is time-consuming and can be painful. But technology has stepped up in recent years and smart glucose sensors have made diabetes care easier. The current leader on the market is the FreeStyle Libre by American medical company Abbott. It is used by three million people in over 50 counties. The small circular sensor sticks to the back of the upper arm, which is then scanned with your smartphone to get a glucose reading. \u201cCompared to traditional blood glucose monitoring this is a huge step forward in making glucose monitoring seamlessly fit into a person's daily lifestyle,\u201d said Ansgar Resch, Abbott diabetes care divisional vice president for commercial operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Pakistan. One of the reasons it has become popular is not just for ease of use but also because it allows people to better control their health. \u201cAs soon as people see information, e.g. their glucose levels going up or down after taking certain food, they make changes,\u201d he told Euronews. The data can also be shared securely with doctors for telehealth appointments. This has become more important for diabetes patients since the coronavirus pandemic because diabetics are generally more vulnerable to the dangers of Covid-19. \u201cPairing widespread telehealth with sensor-based technologies could transform the way we treat the condition \u2013 also long after the pandemic passes,\u201d Resch said. \u2018Too expensive and too few\u2019 solutions for all Despite the FreeStlye Libre being cheaper than other similar products, starting from around \u20ac111, and being fully or partially reimbursed by some healthcare systems, not everyone can afford it and even the traditional finger-pricking devices can be too expensive for some. Other medicines and technologies for diabetes care are evolving. Some of the newer technologies include closed-loop/artificial pancreas systems, which constantly measure your blood glucose and regulate your insulin level with little input required from people living with diabetes. \u201cBut they are not as yet widely available or accessible to the majority of people,\u201d said Sabine Dupont, a senior consultant at the European division of the International Diabetes Federation. There are many issues in access to technologies and medicines and that are not just due to cost. Other important factors are how to evaluate the benefits of newer technologies to determine reimbursement. Discussions between manufacturers, payers and health system also need to take place at a European level to ensure citizens have full access to medicines and technologies. \u201cI think one of the barriers is that innovation is still very often considered a cost rather than an opportunity,\u201d she told Euronews. More transparent procurement mechanisms are also needed, she said, because it can take time for new medicines and technologies to arrive on the market. There are also huge disparities as to when the same new medicine/technology becomes available in all European countries. This is partly because after new medicines/technologies have been approved for use at the European level, it can take even more time to go through further approval at a national level to obtain reimbursement. But if these issues were ironed out, living with diabetes could be made much simpler. \u201cIf you have access and affordable access to the required medicines and technologies, you can actually live a very healthy life with diabetes,\u201d Dupont said.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "The diabetes epidemic is already upon us - can technology save us?"}
{"_id": "101402598109_10158475196378110", "content": "In April, the EU will become the first global power to lay out detailed plans for regulating artificial intelligence, including rules on the use of biometric surveillance technologies, like public facial recognition. Biometric technologies collect data unique to our bodies and behaviours, which divulge sensitive information about who we are. Over half of EU countries are using facial recognition and similar tools in ways that conflict with their own human rights rules , European Digital Rights (EDRi) advocacy group found. Despite being promoted as an easy solution to crime, the reality is that these invasive technologies are often based on unscientific and discriminatory foundations. They are deployed by powerful actors trying to play God and benefit only the tech companies that sell them. Naively at best, our governments are setting up the perfect conditions for the anti-democratic mass surveillance of entire populations. Now, Europeans are fighting back \u2014 the Reclaim Your Face movement has launched a pan-European petition to push EU institutions into banning the harmful use of these technologies. Whilst facial recognition technology has been around for decades, the last few years have seen an increasing desire from cash-strapped councils and police forces to automate using people\u2019s facial and vocal expressions, body movements and behaviours to predict whether or not that person is \u201csuspicious\u201d. Earlier this month, the EU\u2019s highest court handled a case about controversial AI \u201clie detector\u201d tests through a project called iBorderCTRL . MEP Patrick Breyer is suing the European Commission for this EU-funded pilot, which ran between 2016 and 2019. According to the Commission, the project aimed to speed up checks for non-EU nationals travelling to the EU. In reality, it used invasive biometric analysis of emotions, which some scientists have said do not work, to determine whether or not to grant someone the freedom to travel. iBorderCTRL and similar EU-funded projects have been criticised for the secrecy under which these suspected rights-violating experiments have been carried out, for being part of increasingly inhumane migration control strategies , and for infringing on people\u2019s \" cognitive liberty \". Another example can be seen in the Netherlands, where authorities are using biometric technologies to predict people\u2019s aggressiveness. We are witnessing authorities spending huge sums of money on data-driven biometric tech as an easy shortcut to complex societal problems. They are doing this instead of investing in education, welfare or in creating trust with communities, which are more effective methods of reducing crime and improving equal access to opportunities. Scientists have shown the inherent structural discrimination embedded in biometric systems. Research shows that facial analysis algorithms consistently judge black faces to be angrier and more threatening than white faces. We also know that biometric systems are designed with a purportedly \u201cneutral\u201d face and body in mind, which can exclude people with disabilities and anybody that does not conform to an arbitrary norm. Kitting out our streets, supermarkets , and parks with these technologies will amplify existing discrimination against people of colour, people with disabilities, and other marginalised groups. Instead of being contestable, these practices will be hidden under a veil of false scientific authority and deliberate opacity . London police, for example, claim that facial recognition is never used alone to make a decision. Yet, research from the University of Essex shows that humans are psychologically discouraged from challenging AI-based decisions due to the heavy burden of disproving it. In short: \u201cComputer says no.\u201d In claiming to know what people are thinking or are going to do next, the latest generation of biometric systems is propelling us towards a technologically-enabled thought-police. Through \u201cmind-reading\u201d experiments like iBorderCTRL, the EU is legitimising flimsy pseudoscience and opening the door to ever-more-invasive biometric predictions. The technology ignores the fact that expressions and emotions vary greatly at both a cultural and an individual level. Biometric detection of suspicion, by contrast, forces everyone to act according to an arbitrary technological standard. Governments are opening a pandora\u2019s box where state control extends not just to everything we do, but to our innermost thoughts, and applying it in contexts where our innocence or guilt is predicted on the basis of our biometric data. These tools and practices are the dreams of any police state par excellence and the antithesis of the rule of law. But we have an opportunity to stop them before they become pervasive in our societies. The European Reclaim Your Face campaign, which EDRi backs, calls to permanently end biometric mass surveillance like iBorderCTRL. Its petition , which it hopes will gather 1 million signatures, launching today, aims to promote a future where people will not be segmented based on how they look, their religion, sexuality, disability, and other factors that make up our diverse identities. History could not give us a clearer warning about what happens when societies are divided and turned against one another on the basis of who is constructed as suspicious, abnormal and aberrant. EU countries will decide whether or not the development and use of AI will be legally controlled. As the first continent to consider regulating these fast-moving technologies, it has the power to set a global example by, for example, banning biometric mass surveillance practices. This would ensure that we can all enjoy the presumption of innocence, free from the judgment of machines that strip us of our dignity, violate our bodily and psychological integrity, and threaten our democratic freedoms. We urge you to #ReclaimYourFace alongside us.", "source_name": "Euronews English", "title": "Mass facial recognition is the apparatus of police states and must be regulated | View"}

The European Union is finalizing a plan to toughen export controls on technologies used for espionage and surveillance outside the bloc, two officials involved in the negotiation told POLITICO. The new restrictions would affect exports of \"dual use\" technologies, including hacking software and facial recognition systems, by requiring companies to obtain a license to sell such products abroad and governments to publish details about the licenses they grant. The move strengthens the case of security hawks who have been calling for a bolder response to surveillance practices in countries like China. Export controls have taken center stage in the raging trade conflict between the U.S. and China as Washington pummeled telecom giant Huawei with such restrictions over the past two years . European countries \"need to make sure that authoritarian regimes such as China or Russia are not simply given the newest technology for our short term profit. They have [been] shown to copy, steal and use this technology against us and other democratic countries,\" said Mark\u00e9ta Gregorov\u00e1, an MEP from the Czech Pirate Party and lead negotiator on the file. The update to EU rules, expected to be agreed within weeks, would set up a comprehensive EU list of technologies that governments can control through licensing. It would also increase due diligence obligations on companies to check if their goods can be used by their clients to violate human rights. \"For the EU to be a global player and to continue to set values-based rules for trade and technology this legislation was an important test,\" said Marietje Schaake, a former MEP and current international policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center who worked on the file up until last year. Lawmakers have squabbled over a revision of export rules for years. Negotiators from the European Parliament, Commission and Council are expected to hammer out an agreement in a final round of talks soon. The German government has indicated it wants to close the deal under its presidency of the EU Council, which ends in December. A spokesperson for the presidency said it \u201cis strongly committed to swiftly conclude the trilogue discussions.\" The latest draft text, seen by POLITICO, would significantly increase transparency obligations on governments, helping NGOs and human rights groups name and shame those that fail to respect the rules. \"Member States until now didn\u2019t care to report their export data. They cannot do that anymore anonymously,\" said Gregorov\u00e1. \"Some will continue to attempt to hide [which licenses they grant] with excuses of national security ... But I believe that most Member States understand the common threat of uncontrolled cyber-surveillance exports.\" Earlier research by a group of investigative journalists showed that many governments often failed to report their licenses accurately and that requests for licenses were almost never rejected. The EU's rules would go beyond the internationally agreed Wassenaar arrangement on \"dual use\" goods. National representatives in the Council of the EU have \"assured us that facial recognition and intrusion software will be in scope\" of the final text, Gregorov\u00e1 said. Still, much of the legal power to stop exports of surveillance and spyware goods would remain with national governments, creating potential loopholes for companies to continue with shady exports. The Commission before the summer pushed countries to impose tougher requirements on companies to alert authorities when they suspect goods could be used for espionage or surveillance. A watered-down agreement \"will unfortunately not have decisive impact,\" Schaake said. The U.S. administration has used export control instrument to block Chinese technology firms from gaining ground to great effect. Huawei in particular has faced devastating restrictions ever since the U.S. administration started blocking American and foreign companies from doing business with the Chinese telecom giant. Washington has waged a diplomatic campaign since at least 2018 to convince European countries to follow their lead. In one case, Reuters reported the U.S. State Department pressured the Dutch government to block exports by semiconductor company ASML to China, in an effort to cripple China's development of chip technology. The Chinese government has signaled it is seeking to retaliate against Washington's use of the tool. Chinese legislators this week submitted a new draft law that would allow the country to impose similar blocks on grounds of national security and national interests. In Europe, trade officials have used the controls in a much more haphazard way. But that could change, as European lawmakers revise their China policies to take a tougher stance against Beijing's mass surveillance practices, the suppression of Muslim Uighurs in Western China and the crackdown on political protesters in Hong Kong. The new export control rules, if implemented correctly, would allow the EU \"to act as a stronger entity and control autonomously and united certain sensitive exports\" like \"emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing, AI systems, quantum computing,\" said Gregorov\u00e1.

{"_id": "587266261407195_2106261506174322", "content": "But Washington and Brussels are far from seeing eye to eye on how to regulate the technology. In late February, U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer Lynn Parker traveled to Paris with a mission. She had come for a meeting with other government officials at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and she wanted to spread the word that it was high time for the West to join forces and beat China at writing the global rules for artificial intelligence. Parker's plea came as a surprise to others. Less than two years earlier, Donald Trump's White House had rejected a similar pitch by France and Canada during a Group of Seven (G7) meeting, arguing that international rules for AI would be premature and hamper innovation. But China\u2019s blatant ambitions to become the world leader in AI had since alarmed U.S. policymakers and tech executives. Not only was Beijing pouring billions into the research and development of AI, but reports also suggested that the Chinese government was using it to build up an all-seeing surveillance state. And it was becoming increasingly clear that, as the country's tech giants were exporting their technology around the globe, China was pushing for its ideas to become international standards. This convinced the White House that, despite differences with its allies over what rules are needed, Western countries should band together to make sure their companies, rather than Beijing's, remained at the forefront of developing AI. \u201cWe\u2019ll never apologize for wanting to have the use of technology in a way that is consistent with our values,\u201d Parker told POLITICO over the phone from Paris. By joining ranks, she added, the West would be able to come up with \u201ca good counter to what China is doing.\u201d What she didn't say at the time was that the White House was also ready to revisit the Franco-Canadian proposal from 2018. Four months later, in June 2020, the U.S. signed on to a tweaked version of the pitch, announcing that all G7 members (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.) plus Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, India, Slovenia and the EU would launch an alliance dubbed the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) to support the \"responsible and human-centric development and use\" of AI. The idea was to do it \"in a manner consistent with human rights, fundamental freedoms and our shared democratic values,\" the countries added in a statement. In other words: a different approach from China's. As artificial intelligence changes societies around the world, this new GPAI alliance as well as the OECD have emerged as the key arenas for the U.S., Europe and other Western countries to join forces and come up with global standards for AI. But first, Europe and the U.S. need to see eye to eye, and that isn't a given. They agree on what they don\u2019t want \u2014 a future in which AI is used to build up an Orwellian surveillance apparatus \u2014 but they\u2019re far from able to agree on what they do want. The EU, home of stringent privacy laws, wants to become a leader in \u201ctrustworthy\u201d AI and plans to release the world's first laws for AI early next year. This, Brussels hopes, will protect Europeans against abuse and boost consumer trust in European AI while giving its industry a competitive advantage in the long run. The U.S., on the other hand, considers Brussels' approach \u201cheavy-handed\" and \"innovation-killing,\u201d echoing the position of its own tech industry, whose representatives have warned that too many rules would stifle innovation. In feedback to a first draft of Europe's upcoming laws for AI, submitted to the EU in May, for instance, industry giant Google warned Brussels that too many new rules would \u201csignificantly weaken Europe\u2019s position vis-a-vis global competitors.\u201d The job of the new GPAI alliance, which will meet for the first time in December, will be to bring those two positions together. Few details have been shared with the public about the partnership. But a series of conversations with officials and appointed members, conducted on the condition of anonymity because the work is confidential, suggests that it does not intend to work on any legal instruments. But its role will likely go beyond bringing top-notch AI scientists and policymakers to the same table \u2014 and could influence the OECD's work on developing detailed AI principles, which in turn are meant to provide a framework for governments drafting hard laws. The work to form a Western alliance on AI comes as the technology is moving from the realm of science fiction into everyday use. Today, AI is used to treat cancer , predict the outbreak of violent conflicts , analyze satellite data to monitor migration patterns , power military operations and even write news articles . But it also comes with significant risks, beyond being abused by governments to spy on their citizens: Most of today\u2019s cutting-edge AI systems are, for example, prone to discriminate against vulnerable groups and minorities. This has led to text analysis software labeling being Jewish or being gay as negative, British students from poor areas being disadvantaged during exams, or a Black American being arrested for a crime he did not commit. Against this backdrop, organizations ranging from the Catholic Church to Big Tech corporations have all released nonbinding ethical principles for how to develop and use AI. Yet these have not stopped companies and governments from rolling out invasive technology, including in privacy-conscious Europe, where law enforcement is now using facial-recognition technology with minimal public oversight. What rules do exist have largely been developed by industry players \u2014 such as Google, Facebook and Apple in the U.S., or Tencent and Alibaba in China \u2014 for themselves. \u201cThe rules for AI are, in effect, being written in code by the biggest tech companies who have the biggest AI research and the biggest pools of data and the biggest connection to a number of people who are the providers of data,\u201d said Mark Surman, the executive director of the Mozilla Foundation. While policymakers have long been told by the industry that AI systems are black boxes whose inner workings are virtually impossible to understand, that argument is now falling on deaf ears. Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist and professor of ethics and technology at Berlin-based Hertie School, said that governments \u201care starting to understand that [the tech industry] is not that different from the pharma industry, or finance.\u201d \u201cWhen you start to understand that it\u2019s all software \u2026 and someone chooses which algorithms to use, which data to use, what threshold of performance to achieve, you realize that those are all things you can check and regulate,\u201d she added. The hard part for governments will be to come up with the rules. While European leaders are eyeing laws as sweeping as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.S. has been pushing a light-touch approach to regulation within its own borders. Even so, governments involved in GPAI acknowledge that to regulate the global AI industry, international rules are needed \u2014 rules that are often drafted in standard-setting bodies where China has been particularly active over the past decade. Beijing has notably been pushing its ideas inside the Internet Engineering Task Force, an international organization developing core protocols for the internet; and technical standard-setting bodies like the United Nations\u2019 International Telecommunication Union, whose recommendations are often made policy by countries in the Global South. \u201cThey really have made a big push over the last 10 years,\u201d said Michael R. Nelson, who directs the technology and international affairs program at think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"They've also hired consultants to work with the companies to push their visions.\" To counter these efforts, the West is seeking to build its own community, and seems to have found it at the OECD. In May 2019, the organization released its own broad guidelines for the use and deployment of AI, the first international agreement on AI endorsed by Trump\u2019s White House. In addition \u2014 and with the White House's blessing \u2014 the OECD in February launched an initiative to monitor and develop best practices in governing AI. It wasn't until the spring of this year, when it became clear that the OECD would host the secretariat of the GPAI, that the U.S. decided to throw its weight behind the new alliance, according to officials involved in the negotiations. \u201cThe U.S. decided to join because it was better to be inside the tent influencing its efforts than outside,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank whose board includes members of tech giants like Amazon or Google. The new alliance will be governed by a council, which will meet annually at the OECD in Paris. Apart from that, most details are still yet to be decided. What's already become clear, however, is that finding a joint position won't be easy. When members of one of the partnership's four working groups met for a first confidential online meeting earlier this summer, it didn't take long until participants from Europe and the U.S. started clashing over issues such as which players in the industry deserved the greatest support from policymakers, according to one participant.

{"_id": "587266261407195_2088778397922633", "content": "School grades are not the only area where algorithms have a say. British students sent a clear message to policymakers last week: \"F*ck the algorithm.\" The outcry worked. A week after algorithm-generated grades resulted in almost 40 percent of students getting lower grades than predicted, the government said students would get teacher-predicted grades after all. The scandal underlined the creeping influence of algorithms in our lives \u2014 and the subsequent pushback. \"From benefits fraud assessments, to visa algorithms, to predictive policing systems, we\u2019re increasingly moving towards government by algorithm. And the grading fiasco this week in Britain shows that when people realise it\u2019s there, they don\u2019t like it,\" said Cori Crider, whose tech justice group Foxglove backed a legal claim against the grading algorithm. For governments, algorithms promise to make time-consuming and costly decision-making better, more efficient and cheaper. But critics say that automated systems are being rolled out with little transparency or public debate, and risk exacerbating existing inequalities. \"The algorithm takes the biases and prejudices of the real world and \u2018bakes them in\u2019, and gives them a veneer that makes it seem like a policy choice is actually neutral and technical. But it isn\u2019t,\" said Crider. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives people the right to an explanation of a decision based on automated means, and people can object to the decision if it is based solely on an algorithm. But the grading scandal revealed the GDPR's shortcomings in dealing with algorithms. Regulators said the grading algorithm had not relied solely on automated means \u2014 it said humans were involved in the process \u2014 implying that any objection to the decision on these grounds wouldn't stand. Demand for greater transparency is further complicated by the owners of algorithms who argue they are trade secrets whose inner workings cannot be made public. British computer scientist and privacy campaigner Michael Veale is also skeptical of the power of regulation like the GDPR to act as a bulwark against algorithms. The right to an explanation of an algorithm-generated decision does little to fix \"systemic injustices\" built into algorithms like the one used to grade British students, he said. \"Getting an explanation but no democratic say in how systems work is like getting a privacy policy without a \u2018do not consent\u2019 button,\" he said. Here are some of the ways in which algorithms are running our lives. Deciding who gets access to welfare and how much is a costly business for governments, and so has become an area that has seen a boom in the use of algorithms. The Swedish city of Trelleborg has automated parts of its social benefits program so that new applications are combined with other database to come to a decision. Denmark's been getting on the welfare algorithm bandwagon too, building a \"surveillance behemoth\" in the process, activists say. In England, local authorities began using algorithms to determine how much money to spend on each person nearly 10 years ago. In one high profile example, a registered blind wheelchair user had his allowance cut by \u00a310,000 after his local authority began using the system. But activists started fighting back. In April, Dutch activists got a system used by government to detect welfare fraud banned after a court found it violated privacy. Hungary, Greece and Latvia have trialled a system called iBorderCtrl that screens non-EU nationals at EU borders , using automated interviews with a virtual border guard, based on \u201cdeception detection technology.\" The system is in effect an automated lie-detector test taken before the person arrives at the border. In Slovenia, a border police system automatically matches travellers to \u201cother police data\u201d such as criminal files. Here again, there is pushback. Watchdogs have filed complaints against the Slovenian system, while the U.K. government said earlier this year it would scrap an algorithm used to used to screen visa applicants following a complaint. The groups behind the complaint argued the algorithm was racist, and favored applications from countries with a predominantly white population. Using algorithms to model when and where crime will happen \u2014 an area known as predictive policing \u2014 is on the rise. In 2019, British civil rights group Liberty warned that the growth in the use of computer programs to predict crime hotspots and people who are likely to reoffend risks embedding racial profiling into the justice system. In 2016, a Belgian police department started implementing a predictive policing system which they claimed can predict neighbourhoods where burglaries are more likely to take place. In the German city of Mannheim, authorities have installed a video surveillance system that monitor people's behaviour for \"certain patterns ... that indicate criminal offences.\" Employers in Finland used to be able to use the services of DigitalMinds, a company that analyzed candidates' online presence \u2014 on Twitter, Facebook and their email inbox \u2014 to come up with a personality assessment. Measures tracked included how active individuals are online and how they react to posts and emails. The company folded following an investigation by AlgorithmWatch. Having your credit rating scored by a private company is a fact of life for many, and can have far-reaching consequences. A low score typically means banks may turn down a loan or credit card application, or that internet service providers or phone companies may deny service. The score you get may also be based on questionable data. Earlier this month, activists filed a complaint with the Austrian data protection watchdog after a credit scoring company gave a customer that did not owe debts and had a well-paying job a bad score, but denied holding any data on the person.

{"_id": "587266261407195_2075271102606696", "content": "After Huawei, all eyes are on TikTok. But security hawks are also looking at other Chinese tech firms. Huawei. TikTok. Who's next? The United States government this week launched a new phase in its campaign to push back on Chinese technology firms, announcing efforts to block cloud and software companies from China from thriving in the West. The move was flanked by a decision Thursday to block business dealings with social media company TikTok and chat app WeChat and follows a two-year-long diplomatic campaign against telecom giant Huawei, as officials warned repeatedly that these firms don't play by Western rules, particularly when it comes to snooping and data protection. And there's more coming. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is scheduled to visit Central Europe next week, signaled Washington's plans to use its trade and export tools against a broader range of Chinese technology firms. Those efforts will likely spill over into Europe, where privacy concerns, human rights woes, security and trade interests are advancing political pushback against Chinese tech. POLITICO lists the likely targets in China's technology sector that are drawing the attention of security authorities, data protection groups, trade officials and China hawks alike. TikTok is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance and has a sister application in China called Douyin. The app has become immensely popular with young people worldwide: It was the most downloaded app in the first three months of 2020. What\u2019s the fuss: U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order Thursday banning \u201ctransactions\u201d with ByteDance, alleging the company shares user data with the Chinese state. ByteDance denies the allegations, saying its user data is stored in the U.S. and Singapore. It said it will build a new data center in Ireland. It is now mulling a sale of a chunk of its business to Microsoft to avoid the ban. Between the lines: Like most advertising-funded social media platforms, TikTok collects a lot of user data, raising privacy concerns. The platform\u2019s young clientele is an added cause for concern. What Europe thinks: Calls for a ban have so far not been echoed in Europe , even in capitals that have taken tough stances against Huawei. Europe's grouping of privacy regulators set up a task force to look into TikTok earlier this year, and several national watchdogs are also investigating the app. The new Irish data center could shake up ongoing privacy probes in Europe, which could be entrusted to the Irish Data Protection Commission. WeChat, owned by Tencent, is sometimes called a \"super app,\" offering messaging, social media and payment functionalities to its users. It's relatively small outside China. What\u2019s the fuss: Trump issued an executive order against WeChat, similar to the one on TikTok, barring \u201ctransactions\u201d with the company. Pompeo said earlier on Fox News that the app was \u201cfeeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d Between the lines: WeChat would have access to large amounts of personal data from its individual users. A recent report by the Toronto-based digital rights research organization Citizen Lab also showed the app used its international users' posts to train its domestic version to better censor the Chinese internet. What Europe thinks: Privacy and human rights concerns could play well with European digital rights groups and politicians. Alibaba is China's dominant e-commerce and cloud company. The firm has data centers in China, the U.S., Germany and the U.K., among other countries. What\u2019s the fuss: Founder Jack Ma met Trump days before he took office as president in 2017, and promised to create 1 million jobs in the U.S. Relations have soured since but Alibaba's name had remained largely absent from the U.S. onslaught against Chinese tech giants. That changed this week, when Pompeo announced plans to create \u201cClean Cloud,\u201d which would bar Alibaba from getting access to U.S. citizens\u2019 personal data and companies\u2019 corporate data. Another concern goes back to last year, when the city of Hangzhou said it would embed state officials at tech companies including Alibaba \u2014 blurring the lines between the company and the state. What Europe thinks: Alibaba\u2019s cloud services arm has data centers in Europe and caters to the Continent\u2019s companies, like Dutch electronics firm Philips . But Europe also wants to move away from foreign cloud providers . Alibaba has also faced harsh criticism from European consumer groups , who warn that the company's e-commerce platform floods the European market with illegal and dangerous items. Founded in 1997 by the son of former Chinese leader Hu Jintao, Nuctech is a state-owned manufacturer of X-ray machines, scanners and explosive detection systems. What\u2019s the fuss: Nuctech is owned by an industrial conglomerate that also works in China's nuclear sector, raising security concerns. Also, the EU put anti-dumping duties on the company's cargo scanning equipment a decade ago. But in recent years it has found success in selling security gear to European airports. \"It's extremely worrisome if a foreign state-funded company gets more and more control over our strategic infrastructure,\" German conservative MEP Axel Voss told POLITICO previously about Nuctech's success in Europe. Between the lines: One worry is that the gear could be used as a transmitter of malicious software. Another is that Nuctech equipment could cause disruption at Europe's airports and borders if it were to be misused by foreign actors. The case of Nuctech also poses tough questions for Europe's competition authorities, who have trouble protecting the European market from Chinese companies that undercut the prices of European players. DJI is a private drone-manufacturing company based in Shenzhen. It's the biggest beneficiary of the explosion in the world's drone market, securing a 74 percent share, according to 2018 estimates . What\u2019s the fuss: The U.S. government has moved away from using DJI drones in recent years. Security officials fear the data gathered through the drones could include detailed imagery of critical infrastructure, military hardware, frontiers or nuclear sites. DJI officials rushed to assuage concerns, insisting it has access to \u201cessentially none\u201d of the data its drones produce. Between the lines: The main problem is that DJI\u2019s non-Chinese alternatives are considered up to 10 times as expensive \u2014 a hard pill to swallow for public authorities procuring gear. What Europe thinks: National and local governments across the bloc are using DJI drones for surveillance and inspection purposes, as POLITICO has reported . Government authorities have largely dismissed concerns by arguing the drones are only used for non-sensitive work, but both German and French militaries as well as British police use their drones. Video surveillance company Hikvision is a market leader in providing closed-circuit television and surveillance systems to public authorities across the world. Its controlling shareholder is a state-owned defense conglomerate. What\u2019s the fuss: The U.S. in 2018 barred the company from providing equipment to the federal government. In October 2019, it also added the company to the export controls \u201centity list\u201d due to its work with public authorities in Xinjiang, where the government is accused of persecuting the Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group. What Europe thinks: The company has subsidiaries in a number of European countries. It has had success selling to British authorities , in particular, despite calls from national politicians to investigate the company. At the heart of political concerns around Chinese tech is a cocktail of trade worries, human rights woes, security interests and data protection considerations \u2014 as both the U.S. and Europe seek to rebalance diplomatic relations with Beijing. One concern China\u2019s tech companies face is the country\u2019s domestic intelligence and security legislation , which \"obliges\" companies to \"assist and cooperate\" state intelligence services. Another is that Chinese security services could more easily hack and manipulate software and hardware from domestic firms, as the EU grows \"more suspicious\" of Chinese cyber espionage campaigns. Governments also fear that European champions might get outcompeted by China\u2019s growing companies. And Chinese tech companies have come under scrutiny for their role in supporting the Beijing government\u2019s detention of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang province and the crackdown on protests in Hong Kong. Critics of the campaign against China's tech firms have pointed out these risks aren\u2019t limited to Chinese products: Many Western firms have China-based manufacturing plants and deep commercial ties with Chinese manufacturers. In Europe, critics also point to the U.S.\u2019s own mass surveillance schemes exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden years ago. Want more analysis from POLITICO ?

PARIS \u2014 Take a walk along Nice\u2019s famous Promenade des Anglais without a face mask and you'll get shouted at. The city on the French Riviera is using cameras equipped with speakers so that police can forcefully remind people to respect rules to stop the spread of coronavirus, local media reported. \u201cIn the event of a brawl or large grouping, for example, the city's police can talk directly to the people concerned and shout 'Watch out! We can see you, a crew is coming,'\" Anthony Borr\u00e9, Nice's deputy mayor in charge of security, told local newspaper Nice Matin . The city also broadcasts pre-recorded messages every 30 minutes between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. in areas where tourists and locals gather, reminding them of social distancing rules and the necessity of throwing away their trash. \u201cIt's like a sci-fi show,\u201d one unnamed tourist told Nice Matin. The conservative mayor, Christian Estrosi, on Monday issued a decree enforcing mask-wearing outdoors, a measure that goes further than the nationwide rules that masks must be worn in enclosed spaces. Estrosi plans to broadcast more messages in the coming days reminding people of the new rules. Other major French cities, including Lille, Biarritz and Toulouse, have begun to take similar measures as the number of cases rises again , with the national Scientific Council fearing a second wave in the fall. Nice has a history of using surveillance technology. It was the first city in France to trial facial recognition technology on its streets \u2014 which are constantly monitored by around 2,600 CCTV cameras. In April, the French city also tried using drones to call on people to respect the lockdown.

When you reach your destination, however, things are not yet back to normal. Some countries have remnants of their lockdown measures in place along with social distancing rules and bans on large events. Face masks will be an essential travel accessory for most tourists. Here's a guide to what to expect when you arrive in the EU27 and the U.K. and the lockdown path that led there \u2014 ordered by the duration of each country's lockdown: Austria | Belgium | Bulgaria | Croatia | Cyprus | Czech Republic | Denmark | Estonia | Finland | France | Germany | Greece | Hungary | Ireland | Italy | Latvia | Lithuania | Luxembourg | Malta | Netherlands | Poland | Portugal | Romania | Slovakia | Slovenia | Spain | Sweden | United Kingdom  Reopening timeline: Sweden was the poster child for a light-touch approach, but the government recommended people limit personal contacts and apply social distancing.

{"_id": "587266261407195_2012598778873929", "content": "Experts say mass testing, contact tracing, COVID treatments and basic public health are just as important. What if all it took for the world to return to normal was a shot in the arm? Politicians are repeating the mantra that a coronavirus vaccine is the exit strategy. But getting there is neither simple nor even guaranteed. \"A vaccine is not a given,\" said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology and distinguished fellow at Chatham House. There are hundreds of vaccine candidates in development, but the vast majority will fail. Assuming one is successful, it could take years to manufacture billions of doses for the entire globe. With this in mind, \u201cwaiting for a vaccine is a poor, poor exit strategy,\" Heymann argued. He and other experts say that the idea that a vaccine is the only way out could provide people with false hope and ignore other vital public health measures already at our disposal. For example, politicians could give equal attention to a COVID-19 cure or to more comprehensive testing methods \u2014 or promote simple public health measures like hand washing. \u201cInstead of going for silver bullets and moonshots, the focus should be on doing the hard slog of public health,\" said Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. Here are four public health measures that experts say need to be put in place. But spoiler alert: Most require up-front investment and have their own hurdles. One of the clear ways out is knowing who has the virus. Testing was key at the start of the pandemic, but as people emerge from lockdown, \"it acquires an even more important position,\" said John Middleton, president of the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region. As the number of infected people dwindles, pinpointing who has the virus makes it possible to put up a \" cordon sanitaire \" and focus on the ill and those they've been in contact with. But it's also vital in another way, he noted, by understanding factors like the geographical extent of the spread. \"You can look at surveillance and population studies to see how far the virus has spread, and what level of immunity there might be in the country,\" Middleton added. \"That could influence how safe it is to [scale back] lockdown.\" There are, as always, obstacles to surmount. First, ramping up capacity has been a problem for many countries. In the U.S., cuts to public health budgets mean that there's a lack of qualified personnel and machinery. Testing capacity there had to be built from scratch, Middleton explained. In the U.K., shortages of reagents meant that testing was reserved for those who were ill in the hospital. Inaccurate testing is another problem. With popular nasal swab tests, false negatives rates can be as high as three in 10. For more precise blood tests, the opposite is a bigger problem \u2014 false positives leading people to think they've contracted the virus and are immune, thus skewing statistics, Middleton explained. \"Politicians have seen it as a beauty contest \u2014 how many tests are done \u2014 without a proper understanding about the results,\" Middleton said. The good news is that the technology is improving, and better, more rapid tests are coming along, he added. Austrian geneticist Hans Lehrach, of the Max Planck Institute, thinks it's time for a completely new way of testing. \"This requires a different approach to testing as landing a man on the moon required a different approach than hot air balloons,\" Lehrach said. Lehrach's idea is that governments could test everyone in a given country or in the EU for five consecutive weeks by genetic sequencing. If countries did this, they could effectively eliminate the virus in that area. It would require citizens' and governments' buy-in \u2014 literally. But so far, governments have been slow to take on this new testing approach. \"Whatever we do will not be for free,\" Lehrach said. But he argues that this approach would eliminate the virus from the targeted area and allow people to go back to restaurants and work knowing \"that everybody they meet is free of the virus.\" If there's one immediate priority that governments should invest in for the short term, it's contact tracing, argues Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe countries that are able to resume normal life \u2014 Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea \u2014 they ... have the infrastructure to be able to do really granular and effective contact tracing,\u201d Wenham said. This requires an effective application and staff who can \u201cjoin the dots.\u201d \u201cWhen one person gets infected, [the tracers] can notify who they\u2019ve been in contact with, and reach the people that weren\u2019t on the app for whatever reason. A bank of staff that can do that last mile,\u201d she said. Numerous European countries are trying to do this already, including the U.K. and Germany. But they're running into two problems. Many of these apps aren't interoperable across borders, so their effectiveness at fighting major public health problems is not known. And many people are afraid of signing up. \u201cFor a lot of Europeans, it\u2019s not a natural thing to have the government tracking everything on your phone and your movements,\u201d said Wenham. Assuring people that their data is safe , and not being used for any other purposes \u2014 for example to be sold to third parties \u2014 is key here, Wenham added. \"This is a dataset that would be rich for selling,\" she said. \"You need to make sure that you have that data security.\" One major advantage that therapies have over vaccines is that they're easier to test \u2014 and therefore faster to bring to market. David Salisbury, an associate fellow at Chatham House and former director of immunization at the U.K.'s Department of Health, explained that this comes down to the comparative ease of setting up clinical studies for drugs. \"You test [an] antiviral in people who've got the disease, and you hope to see that those that you treat with the antiviral get better and survive better than those who have a placebo or an alternative treatment,\" Salisbury explained. \"With a vaccine, you've got to show that it stops people actually getting infected,\" he said. \"So it has to be administered in a place where the virus is circulating, and administered in extremely large doses.\" This means vaccine developers are constantly racing to roll out clinical trials in places where the virus is still on the rise. Recently, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca launched a new wing of its phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil because that's where the \"epidemiological curve is still rising.\" But regardless of whether and when a vaccine is developed, therapies are necessary, say experts. \u201cWe need drugs before we get a vaccine,\" said Nick Cammack, COVID-19 therapeutics accelerator lead at the Wellcome Trust. \"We need drugs while we have a vaccine ... and we need drugs after we get a vaccine, because even for conditions that we currently have vaccines for you still have breakthrough cases.\" The first line of defense is coming from repurposed drugs, he noted at a webinar organized by the Wellcome Trust last week. These are medicines already developed to fight other diseases and are now being tested to see if they help patients. The two medicines that have been in the spotlight \u2014 remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 fit into this category. However, evidence of their efficacy is, at best, spotty. Remdesivir, an antiviral developed to fight Ebola by drugmaker Gilead, has shown it can moderately shorten the duration of the disease. Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine promised some early hope but has since failed to pay off, with a major British trial declaring negative results. In the medium term, antibodies can also be applied as a therapy, Cammack noted. Plasma from people who have already recovered from the disease carries antibodies against COVID-19. If it\u2019s injected into patients that are currently sick, it can give the immune system a boost to help fight the virus. The problem: You\u2019re limited by the amount of recovered patients you can gather plasma from. An alternative approach is monoclonal antibodies, which are designed and can be mass-produced in a lab. U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly has brought its monoclonal antibodies to phase 1 trial together with AbCellera, and expects results at the end of June. \"In the next six to nine months we will know if monoclonal antibodies that are specific for COVID-19 show safety and efficacy,\" Cammack said. \"There's much excitement around them as potential treatments.\" Specific antiviral medicines to target COVID-19 \u2014 likely to be small molecule drugs \u2014 are further away and require a number of trials. Beyond the measures noted above, experts argue, policymakers need to keep up basic public health work that has become routine since lockdowns started: Washing hands, wearing a mask and keeping distance. \"If [people] are underpinning activities in a country by protecting themselves by social distancing, that's already a major step forward,\" Heymann said. One of the most important tools for politicians is clear communication, especially considering that the public needs to trust that these measures \u2014 testing, contact tracing, drugs and a vaccine, if it's found \u2014 are safe. Trudie Lang, professor of global health research at the University of Oxford, said that this was a lesson first learned from Ebola that's being learned again now: Public health measures are only as effective as the amount of trust the public has in them to work. \u201cWhat messages to use? How to gain public trust?\u201d Lang said, also at the Wellcome webinar. \"In the absence of drugs and vaccines, these are things that we are left with.\" And even if we get a vaccine or an effective treatment, one of the clearest messages from public health officials might be that the virus is here to stay. \u201cThis virus is not going to go away. Period,\u201d the World Health Organization\u2019s David Nabarro told the BBC. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a vaccine and we don\u2019t know we\u2019re going to develop one \u2026 so we\u2019ve all got to learn to live with this virus.\u201d Ashleigh Furlong contributed reporting.

{"_id": "587266261407195_2307743819359422", "content": "Upcoming rules on AI might make Europe\u2019s race issues a tech problem too. Europe's vision of artificial intelligence regulation is color-blind \u2014 and not in a good way. Between the U.S.'s laissez-faire and China's dirigiste approaches, the EU is intent on carving out a \u201c third way \u201d for AI regulation that boosts innovation but respects \u201cEuropean values,\u201d including privacy and human rights. But activists and academics fear the rules will not consider the communities most at risk of AI-based discrimination \u2014 people of color. In recent years, there have been high-profile examples of AI systems discriminating against racial minorities, including facial recognition systems that don\u2019t recognize women or black and brown faces; opaque, unenforceable and discriminatory hiring algorithms ; or applications that predict disproportionate criminality and offer worse legal outcomes. The European Commission will unveil its AI rules this spring, requiring \"high-risk\" AI systems to meet minimum standards regarding trustworthiness. But with European countries already struggling to address racial discrimination when it comes to representation , policing and online abuse , Sarah Chander of digital rights group EDRi said those issues are likely to seep into tech. \u201cWe shouldn't see the issues of the potential harmful impact on racialized communities through tech as a U.S. issue. It's going to be wherever you find manifest structural discrimination and racial inequality,\u201d Chander said, adding that complacent attitudes among policymakers and an unwillingness to recognize the problem will only exacerbate it. Even with strict data protection rules, strong fundamental rights frameworks and a directive on racial equality , European minorities are not safe from algorithmic harms. In January, the Dutch government resigned over a scandal where the government had used an algorithm to predict who is likely to wrongly claim child benefits. Without any evidence of fraud, the tax authority forced 26,000 parents \u2014 singling out parents of dual nationalities and ethnic minorities \u2014 to pay back tens of thousands of euros to the tax authority without the right to appeal. The Dutch Data Protection authority found the tax authority's methods \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d \u201cIt seems like there's a complete disconnect between reality, which is that automating bias, automating prejudice, automating racism that has huge impacts on huge groups within society, and this blind vision that anything that can be automated is a good thing,\u201d said Nani Jansen Reventlow of the Digital Freedom Fund, which supports digital rights through strategic litigation. Nakeema Stefflbauer is the founder of Frauenloop.org, an organization that trains women in tech and runs a network for people of color in tech called Techincolor.eu. Stefflbauer said her daughter recently applied to the University of Amsterdam, and had to sit through an entrance exam that used a controversial exam surveillance software Proctorio, which has a bad track record in recognizing Black and brown faces. If Europe doesn\u2019t \u201chave some type of clear target goal in regulating the outcomes of algorithmic implementation Europe, then we're going to have the same problems that they're having in North America, where it\u2019s like, 'oops, nobody thought about this whole group of women or transgender people, or Black people, or Asian people, or any people that are not white men,'\u201d Stefflbauer said, referring to a slew of legal complaints in the U.S. brought forward as a result of racial bias in AI systems. \"In Europe we should be able to at least avoid the worst of those excesses.\" It's a problem the European Commission is aware of. Last year, Vice President V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 specifically warned against \"copy-pasting the imperfections and unfairness of the real world into the AI world,\" including racial bias. In sketching out its AI plans , the EU warned against the harms AI systems with racial bias could do, adding that any AI law \"should concentrate on how to minimise the various risks of potential harm.\" But it's unclear what provisions the Commission will actually put into upcoming rules. A spokesperson for the Commission did not comment on the upcoming proposal, but said that the EU has a \"solid framework of legislation at EU and national level to protect fundamental rights and to ensure safety and consumer rights. To prevent breaches of these rules and to ensure that possible breaches can be addressed by national authorities, high-risk AI systems need to be well-documented and provide an adequate degree of transparency.\" A coalition of civil society groups, led by EDRi, has campaigned for red lines in the upcoming AI laws that would ban technologies such as live facial recognition, which they warn would discriminate against people of color. EDRi\u2019s Chander argues that such limits are necessary because human oversight or technical fixes alone \u2014 including broader datasets to train algorithms \u2014 cannot be relied upon to erase bias or discriminatory effects. \u201cIt's not necessarily an issue of not enough representation in the datasets that are used, but rather how such systems might perpetuate existing discriminatory impact in society,\u201d Chander said. Conversations about race are often had at national level rather than in Brussels, and \u201ca lot of efforts to deal with systemic racism are not always connected with the conversations about technology,\u201d Jansen Reventlow said. This can lead to these groups being excluded from technical discussions that shape AI policy, said Vanja Skoric, program director at the European Center for Not-For-Profit Law. \u201cOften they themselves don\u2019t feel good enough or \u2018expert enough\u2019 to participate, which leads to a lack of critical important voices in discussions,\u201d she said. Without policymakers and industry actively fielding input from diverse voices \u2014 or in some cases ignoring them or shutting them out \u2014 legislation ends up being poorer as a result. The Council of Europe, the 47-country human rights group that's drafting its own framework on ethical AI, has no specific requirement to ensure representation of marginalized, vulnerable groups or ethnic minorities, Skoric said. A spokesperson for Council of Europe said non-discrimination will be one of the subjects addressed in its upcoming legal framework for AI, which will be ready in the end of 2021. Its steering committee on anti-discrimination, diversity and inclusion has \"agreed that work on AI and non-discrimination will be one of its future priorities\" and the unit will engage in preparing a \"sectoral instrument on AI, non-discrimination and equality,\" the spokesperson added. That absence of representation applies to Brussels , too, which scores poorly in ethnic diversity. Out of 705 members of the European Parliament, only a handful are people of color. All 27 EU commissioners are white. The first thing Europe needs to address is the power structures in AI regulation, said Os Keyes of the University of Washington, who studies gender, race and power in AI systems. If the EU is serious about tackling racial bias in policy, it should also examine its internal power structures, Keyes continued. Keyes said that lack of diversity partly explains discriminatory activities and policies. For example, the EU's research fund paid for a paper on race classification , tech that distinguishes a person\u2019s race through features such as skin color or facial features. The technology has faced harsh criticism from computer scientists who fear that the technology might fuel discrimination, and doesn't take into account the social context of racial identity. The fund has also funneled money to the now-scrapped iBorderCtrl project, which tried to create a border security system that used facial recognition technology to find out if people were lying. Frontex, the European border and coast guard agency has also tested military-grade surveillance drones in the Mediterranean and Aegean to spot migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe. \u201cToo often the decisions about what \u2026 should be regulated are handled by very narrow groups of people with very narrow ranges of interest,\u201d Keyes said.", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "Europe\u2019s artificial intelligence blindspot: Race"}
{"_id": "587266261407195_1550931485040663", "content": "Brexit is distracting lawmakers from examining the controversial use of facial recognition technology. LONDON \u2014 When Wales takes on Ireland in the Six Nations rugby championship Saturday, Big Brother will be watching. Fans filing into the stadium in Cardiff will be scanned with facial recognition software as part of a police trial of the technology. Should any of their faces match a database of potential suspects, officers will be standing by, ready to swoop. It\u2019s the kind of indiscriminate mass surveillance that would be expected, in ordinary times, to be the subject of fierce debate in the U.K., as journalists and politicians fought over the proper balance between privacy and security. Instead, trial runs like the one in South Wales are taking place largely unchallenged by parliament. That, say civil liberty campaigners, is largely because of Brexit. Three years ago, the debate over the Investigatory Powers Act, nicknamed the \"snoopers' charter\" \u2014 which gave security services powers to collect and store personal data for 12 months and track their use of the web, phones and social media \u2014 dominated the front pages of the national papers and was the subject of fierce debate in the U.K. parliament. By comparison, there has been just one debate in the last two years devoted specifically to facial recognition in the U.K. parliament. And that was held in the non-elected House of Lords. \"Facial recognition\" has been referenced just 59 times in the official parliamentary record Hansard since 2014 (11 times during the Lords debate and 21 times during the passing of the Data Protection Bill last year). Meanwhile, the EU Withdrawal Act alone was debated by politicians for more than 272 hours between July 2017 when the legislation was laid before the U.K. parliament and last June when it received royal assent. There has been \u201ca complete failure of politicians to engage with the issue,\u201d said Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, a civil rights group that is taking London\u2019s Metropolitan Police to court over the use of facial recognition technology. \"The [Home Office hasn\u2019t] sought to consult parliament,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t seek to consult human rights experts, wider civil society, NGOs, but rather steamed ahead and [have] plundered millions of pounds into what is clearly really a controversial new form of surveillance.\" Facial recognition techniques are developing rapidly, and police across the world have been eager to add them to their arsenals. This coming weekend in Cardiff will be the 29th time the technology has been deployed by the South Wales police as part of a trial that began in 2017. In addition, the Metropolitan Police in London has deployed the technology 10 times, including at the Notting Hill Carnival. It is currently evaluating the results of its trial, and is due to issue a report in April. Experts say the technology will become increasingly sophisticated, saving hours of police time, as artificial intelligence hones its identification skills. Japan's NEC Corporation, which provides the technology to South Wales and the Metropolitan Police, declined an interview, and would not discuss its technology, or confirm if its algorithms were trained using artificial intelligence. Facial recognition is in use in China, and the German government is testing a system at Berlin\u2019s S\u00fcdkreuz railway station. Allied Market Research expects the global market will be worth $9.6 billion by 2022. So far, however, the results are mixed. At the England versus Wales rugby match in Cardiff on February 23, more than 18,000 scans resulted in 12 potential matches against a watchlist of 700 suspects, according to figures published by South Wales Police. Eight turned out to be false matches. Four were \"positive\" and led to three arrests or \"disposals.\" The technology\u2019s first deployment, during the UEFA Champions League Final in Wales, prompted 2,470 alerts of which all but 173 turned out to be false positives. The trial has also elicited a challenge in court , by Ed Bridges, a Cardiff citizen, who alleges it violates the privacy rights of everyone within range of the cameras, has a chilling effect on peaceful protest and breaches data protection laws. South Wales Police declined a request for an interview while it faces a judicial review. It is not just civil liberties groups that are asking parliament to provide clarity on how facial recognition technology can be used. \u201cIf the public is to have its concerns assuaged, if trust is to be developed, there has to be a very clear regulatory framework and at this stage, I don\u2019t think there is,\" said Tony Porter, the U.K.\u2019s surveillance camera commissioner, who oversees compliance with the U.K.'s surveillance camera code of practice and advises ministers, the public and system operators about effective and appropriate use of surveillance camera systems. He has no powers of inspection, audit or sanction. Porter added that he has yet to be convinced there is a \"very real and serious approach to how government wants to use this type of technology, if indeed it does.\" The U.K. data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, has also raised concerns about the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies in public spaces, and opened an investigation in December. \u201cPolice forces must have clear evidence to demonstrate that the use of [facial recognition technology] in public spaces is effective in resolving the problem that it aims to address, and that no less intrusive technology or methods are available,\u201d a spokesperson for the regulator said. Even the technology\u2019s natural proponents \u2014 law enforcement and technology companies \u2014 are calling on lawmakers to provide clear rules on how it can be used. Brad Smith, the president of software developer Microsoft, said in a blog post in December that it is important for government to start adopting facial recognition laws in 2019. \u201cThe facial recognition genie, so to speak, is just emerging from the bottle,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cUnless we act, we risk waking up five years from now to find that facial recognition services have spread in ways that exacerbate societal issues.\u201d In an interview with the Daily Telegraph in November, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the police are finding themselves \"hamstrung by a quite complex regulatory system, a quite complex legal framework.\u201d Elaborating on her comments, a spokesperson for the force told POLITICO that while police had used existing legislation for its trial, there is no specific legal framework for the use of facial recognition technology. The Met Police is \"keen to ensure that the appropriate legal and ethical frameworks are put in place to support its use,\" the spokesman said. The Home Office declined POLITICO\u2019s interview requests, but said in a statement that it has set up a Biometrics Oversight and Advisory Board and has sought advice from the independent Biometrics and Forensics Ethics Group to ensure police use is appropriate and to maintain public trust. Labour\u2019s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott emailed POLITICO to say her position is that facial recognition should be subject to regulation, which should guard against any risks of discrimination against communities where there had already been injustices. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, called for the use of facial recognition to be halted until proper safeguards could be put in place, in a comment emailed to POLITICO. Civil liberty groups hope the cases against the Met Police and the South Wales Police will spur parliament to act. The legal challenges could act as a \"trip wire\" for lawmakers, according to Porter, the surveillance camera watchdog. But with Brexit yet to be resolved, and a vast legislative agenda associated with Britain's departure from the EU, parliament may continue to struggle to find time to debate the issue. \u201cI do recognize that we are a country that is very heavily focused on a political crisis,\u201d said Porter, although he said he would not comment specifically on the level or extent to which the crisis is preventing further work in the area. But he said he did not see a \"clear intent\" by the government to deliver a legislative framework. Norman Lamb, a Liberal Democrat MP and chair of the parliament\u2019s science and technology committee, said that facial recognition is one of the issues that has not been properly scrutinized because of Brexit. His committee has touched on the regulation of facial recognition as part of a wider probe into the government's biometrics strategy, and is due to hold another evidence session on March 19. \"There are significant potential civil liberties issues at stake and we have to be sure that it is being used responsibly, particularly in the criminal justice system,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Home Office has nearly enough of a sense of urgency here.\" Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned and fought a by-election in protest at the erosion of civil liberties in 2008, told POLITICO he raised concerns about facial recognition technology before joining the government in 2016, but said it is \u201cfair cop\u201d to suggest big dominant issues are being ignored as a result of Brexit. Davis, now a backbencher after walking out of Theresa May's government over her Brexit plans, warned that the \"next big area of argument\" in the civil liberties sphere following the misuse of personal data on Facebook will be around gathering data in public. Facial recognition is the \"tip of the iceberg,\" he warned, pledging to take on the issue himself. \u201cIt is going to be important, and I will be, as I do with these things generally, tending to gradually raise the profile of the thing until people have got the point,\" he said.

{"_id": "587266261407195_1985405164926624", "content": "Tech giants played hardball in forcing policymakers to fall in line with their approach to building digital tracking tools. In the digital fight against COVID-19, Big Tech squared off against governments \u2014 and won. As policymakers around Europe pushed to develop smartphone apps to track the spread of the coronavirus, Apple and Google flexed their muscles by laying out conditions for building the tools, which are now set to be rolled out across the bloc and beyond by early June. In conversations with more than 30 policymakers, data-protection experts, independent computer scientists and tech engineers from across the EU and United States, POLITICO pieced together how Google and Apple got their way, often playing hardball with politicians who have used their opposition to U.S. tech players to earn political capital with local voters. The companies also teamed up with longtime privacy campaigners \u2014 often those who have balked at Silicon Valley's collection of reams of people's personal data \u2014 to push back against concerns about potential government surveillance. In often fraught discussions, officials weighed the need to protect privacy against the public health imperative of tackling a virus that, so far, has left almost 300,000 people dead worldwide. Tech officials and privacy groups set aside longstanding feuds to figure out how to build COVID-19 apps, often condensing months of work into a few weeks. Politicians were left to decide whether to go it alone, often with tech offerings that left much to be desired \u2014 or team up with some of Silicon Valley's biggest names whose take-it-or-leave-it approach rubbed some the wrong way. \"I'm not taking a stand against Apple and Google,\" Cedric O, France's digital minister, told POLITICO after publicly criticizing the companies for refusing to work with Paris' independent coronavirus app. \"I'm saying that I don't want to be constrained by the internal policy choices of any company on a matter of public health.\" As governments grapple to bring the coronavirus to heel, the unlikely alliance between some of the world's largest tech companies and global privacy groups is starting to bear fruit. \"We hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19,\" the companies said when announcing their initiative last month. Both declined to comment on their relationships with governments on creating smartphone apps, though senior engineers involved in the project stressed it was down to governments, not the companies, to determine which approach to use. By June, national capitals from Berlin and Rome to Paris and London will roll out smartphone apps that use mobile technology to trace people's interactions, informing local populations if they have been in contact with others infected with the coronavirus. Most of these programs, which may be in place well into 2021, rely on the approach championed by Google and Apple \u2014 often against initial proposals tabled by policymakers worldwide. The ability of these tech companies to get their way, often with the support of local privacy and security advocates, has raised questions about the role of Big Tech in determining how governments respond to the global public health crisis. With apps soon becoming available that both rely on Google and Apple's procedures, and those that don't, the confusion will hobble Europe's strategy to coordinate its response across the 27-country bloc and elsewhere because the different digital tools cannot interact with each other. \"The interoperability of these apps has been a major blind spot,\" said Michel Beaudouin-Lafon, a computer science professor at the Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, who co-authored a recent report on how these tools should operate. \"From a technical perspective, it will be difficult to get these apps to talk to one another.\" Nowhere are these tensions more apparent than in Germany, home to some of the world's longest-standing privacy protections . Early last month, a German-led group pushed ahead with a toolkit , developed alongside 130 tech experts across eight countries, to build apps that could detect potential infections. Critically, the plan allowed for placing everyone's data on a central server and giving epidemiologists and policymakers access to some of the information, to analyze how the virus spread nationwide. Within days, the initiative hit a brick wall. With little, if any, communication with local experts and EU policymakers, Google and Apple announced on April 10 they had partnered on software which would allow government-backed apps to trace potential infections even while running in the background of people's smartphones. The approach relied on data remaining, for the most part, on people's devices. Both companies refused to open their technology to governments pushing for centralized data storage, a strategy they considered vulnerable to state snooping. German privacy and security experts quickly jumped into action. Within often-heated WhatsApp conversations, some debated whether to throw their support behind Apple and Google. Others questioned if the companies' efforts would cement their already dominant position in the smartphone market. But by late April, following similar warnings by international researchers from more than 25 countries, six influential civil liberties organizations sent an open letter to the German government, criticizing the storage of people's data in one place and warning that it could lead to mass government surveillance. Two days later, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government intervened to ditch the initial German-led proposals in favor of those promoted by Google and Apple. \u201cThe discussion among tech experts killed the credibility and trustworthiness of the technology,\" a high-ranking German official told POLITICO. \"That\u2019s why we decided to go with the different approach.\" Berlin's decision was quickly followed by similar moves in Ireland, Italy and other countries as officials shifted to adopt a decentralized approach, realizing it would be better to partner with the tech giants, and the Germans, if these coronavirus apps were to take off across the EU. The European Commission stressed it is up to national governments to determine which app to use, but urged officials to find ways for the tools to communicate across borders. The choice in Germany was made out of pragmatism rather than conviction \u2014 as well as a growing awareness that Berlin needed to work closely with Apple and Google to develop the app if engineers wanted to avoid serious glitches in their eventual digital tool, according to conversations with almost half a dozen German government and industry officials who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private. \u201cWe need to have a discussion on how Silicon Valley is increasingly taking over the job of a nation state,\u201d said a government official. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need to have it amid a pandemic.\u201d Germany now plans to unveil its app, built by industry giants Deutsche Telekom and SAP, by mid-June, several weeks later than originally planned, in part because the tech giants will not release a key software component until mid-May, the same officials said. While Germany ultimately sided with Apple and Google, France went the opposite way and ended up in an open confrontation with the tech giants. Paris' work started in mid-March just as Singapore was unveiling its own tracking tool. While the country's interior minister said at the time that coronavirus apps were \"not part of French culture,\" O, the country's digital minister, was already making plans with close advisers. Experts at France's National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation in March initially reached out to Apple \u2014 without the backing of the French government \u2014 with technical questions about how such a tracing tool could work, according to a person involved in those discussions. By early April, officials had confirmed they were working on an app that would work by centralizing users' data \u2014 an approach that had also been embraced by Germany, until Google and Apple unveiled their plans in mid-April. French experts close to those discussions told POLITICO that many involved in the project saw the centralized approach as being more privacy-friendly compared to storing data only on people's phones. Not everyone agreed. Amid an intense debate about potential government surveillance, several government coders who favored Apple and Google's plans were excluded from the so-called StopCovid app project, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the project. \"We chose the centralized system because of data protection concerns and issues regarding interconnection with [our] epidemiological system,\" O told POLITICO. Both the country's privacy regulator and National Digital Council said that France's plans complied with EU privacy rules, as long as appropriate oversight was in place. Several people involved in the project said they were caught off-guard by Google and Apple's announcement about the joint coronavirus app project. When they found out, many through the companies' public statements, officials tried to convince them to lift technical restrictions on the French approach that would prevent the StopCovid app from working properly on almost all smartphones. Aymeril Hoang, who sits on the scientific council advising the government on digital tracking, told POLITICO that he spoke repeatedly with S\u00e9bastian Gros, a government relations manager for Apple, after the April 10 announcement to persuade the firm to lift the constraints. His efforts were not successful. Despite that roadblock, France moved ahead with its app that, by the government's own admission, would not fully function on Apple and Google devices because it would switch off when smartphones were in sleep mode. That would be a major stumbling block to the app's primary goal of tracing all potential encounters with infected persons. On April 20, O again urged the companies to work with officials to find a workaround. But his pleas were rebuffed when the tech giants reaffirmed they would only work on projects relying on decentralized data. The digital minister, who was previously an adviser to President Emmanuel Macron, dug in his heels, refusing to bend to the decentralized approach. In particular, he told POLITICO that it should be up to governments, not companies, to determine what's best to protect citizens from the global pandemic. With the country starting to come out of its nationwide lockdown, France now plans to roll out its app by June 2. But the standoff between Paris and Silicon Valley firms continues to divide privacy advocates and government regulators. \"We have a sort of statement of principle that Apple is putting forward that says this or that solution is more or less protective for users without there being any contradictory discussion on the issue,\" S\u00e9bastien Soriano, head of the French telecoms regulator, told POLITICO. \"Perhaps Apple is right and would be able to demonstrate that accepting certain protocols poses risks to its users. But there is no process for independent judges or authorities to decide.\" After an initial stalled response to the global public health crisis, London was eager to show it was on top of tackling COVID-19 \u2014 and quickly turned, in early March, to a potential smartphone tracking app that had proved successful in parts of Asia. Within NHSX, the U.K. health service's newly created tech innovation unit, the debate quickly focused on centralizing people's data \u2014 a strategy then being followed by other countries in Europe \u2014 in part because it would allow nationwide modeling on how the virus was evolving, something that could not be done through a decentralized approach. Ahead of Google and Apple's decision to go down a different path, informal discussions were held between the companies' government affairs executives and some in Westminster to brief policymakers on the upcoming plans. But no formal heads-up was given to the British government, according to three people briefed on the discussions. The announcement divided opinion. Some within NHSX discussed changing the U.K. strategy as questions began to be raised about how the app could access smartphone technology needed to keep the tracing tool running when devices were in sleep mode. Outsiders, including Michael Veale, a British digital rights professor who helped to build a privacy-focused digital tracing tool that was copied by the tech companies' separate efforts, also warned London their efforts could be wasted if they didn't shift gears. \"On the day of the Apple release, I sent them an email to explain their system would not work properly in the background,\" he said. Discussions between the tech companies and U.K. officials remained mostly amicable, often focused on how to get the the U.K.'s app quickly approved for both firms' app stores. But frustrations have also boiled over because of Apple and Google's refusal to work more directly with the U.K.'s centralized approach to its tracing tool, according to two outside consultants briefed on the discussions. On the technical front, the NHSX app was also beset with problems, several times failing basic security and privacy checks required for approval in the health service's procurement process, according to another outside consultant with knowledge of the matter. The Health Service Journal first reported these failures. Privacy groups involved in the initial testing of the U.K. app said their communication with NHSX was patchy, at best. Emails would go days without receiving a response. Basic requirements, like filing a Data Protection Impact Assessment, a mandatory part of any app development, were done after the digital tool began to be tested on the Isle of Wight earlier this month, according to a review of government documents . \"To say the app is limited would be an understatement,\" said Christopher Weatherhead, tech lead at advocacy group Privacy International, who was involved in the tool's early testing. \u201cAs soon as the phone screen is off, the app doesn't scan.\" London still plans to roll out its app nationwide by late May (more than 65,000 people have downloaded it during the test phase). But officials also have approved plans for another tracing tool \u2014 this time based on Google and Apple's approach \u2014 in case the technical limitations of the current app cannot be overcome, according to two people with direct knowledge of the project and government procurement records. The Financial Times first reported the potential U-turn. Nothing has yet to be decided, with officials saying they want to keep every avenue open. But as the U.K. considers jumping ship to join the tech companies, privacy advocates stress the irony that after years of berating Google and Apple for not protecting people's privacy, these tech giants are fast becoming gatekeepers to stop potential government surveillance \u2014 a position that may further cement their position in people's digital lives. \"The most efficient privacy regulators in the world right now are Apple and Google,\" said Daragh O'Brien, a privacy consultant in Dublin who pushed back publicly with other local experts at Ireland's initial efforts to create a centralized app. The government eventually shifted to Google and Apple's approach. \"We are reliant on a duopoly of tech companies that control the operating system market.\" Cristina Gallardo contributed reporting from London, Jacopo Barigazzi and Giorgio Leali contributed reporting from Brussels.

Chinese companies aim to hoover up massive troves of data on other countries to train AI applications and gain a technological edge over Western rivals, warned Ciaran Martin, the U.K.\u2019s departing chief of cybersecurity. While apps like TikTok may not represent an imminent security threat, Martin said their ability to gather huge amounts of user data could help China develop a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d in artificial intelligence and \u201clarge-scale surveillance\u201d capacities that do represent a risk for Western democracies. \u201cIt\u2019s about more than just TikTok ... Western countries need to think hard about their future models for data protection, which Europe has done,\u201d Martin said in an interview with POLITICO, as he moves into a new role in the private sector after 6.5 years at the head of Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, one of the world\u2019s best-resourced cybersecurity operations. \u201cWe need to be mindful of risks of access to population data that the likes of China will seek to acquire and what they\u2019ll do with it,\u201d Martin said, referring to demographic information on the habits and identities of entire populations. TikTok, a hyper-popular video-sharing app, has been branded a security threat by the U.S. government and forced to sell its U.S. operations to Oracle, an American tech company. But that move, pushed by President Donald Trump, has prompted a backlash , with China hawks in the Republican party saying the deal falls short of protecting U.S. security because it would leave TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, in control of the app\u2019s algorithm. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Commerce said it would ban people in the United States from downloading the app from Sunday. Martin stopped short of calling TikTok a security threat. But he said that \u201canything to do with social media and data poses a set of challenges where people should exercise great care\u201d and that the risk \"goes beyond just TikTok.\" \u201cThere is a risk that companies with a legal basis in China are required to give data to the government,\u201d added Martin, who announced Friday he would be joining the advisory board of Paladin Capital Group , a venture capital company specialized in cyber companies. TikTok has so far had a much easier ride in Europe, where it recently passed the 100 million user mark , than in the United States. The firm has sought to allay concerns about data transfers to China by announcing the construction of a data center in Ireland. And while a task force of European data regulators is examining the company\u2019s practices for privacy risks, it faces no imminent clampdown on security grounds. At the helm of the U.K.\u2019s cybersecurity operations since 2013, Martin helped Prime Minister Boris Johnson navigate a searing U.S. pressure campaign to ban Chinese 5G equipment vendor Huawei from European networks \u2014 which resulted in the U.K. deciding to phase out the firm\u2019s kit completely over the next seven years. But Martin was quick to underscore that a ban on Huawei did not solve the West's technological rivalry with China, or even ensure security for future 5G networks. \u201cChinese strategic competition is about much more than Huawei,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people think that by banning Huawei, networks have been made safe \u2014 that\u2019s not true. Much more is needed to secure 5G networks.\u201d In the face of growing concerns about Huawei, politicians and telecoms companies have touted the promise of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) \u2014 a system that would allow multiple vendors to build different parts of the 5G network, rather than just one building the whole thing. But Martin said O-RAN was no quick fix for the dominance of a few players in 5G or reliance on foreign tech companies in general. Instead, Western powers including the U.K. needed to make a concerted push to develop their own telecoms and cybersecurity suppliers and ensure secure supply chains. \u201cFull decoupling [from China] is not really possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to look into resilient supply chains so that we\u2019ll be able to buy high-quality equipment from a greater number of suppliers than in the past.\u201d Looking back over his tenure as the U.K.\u2019s chief cyber guardian, Martin said that, on the whole, the risk posed by cyberattacks, crime and espionage are better understood now than when he started. \u201cWe have been dramatizing catastrophic risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we know now is that it\u2019s [cyberactivity] a chronic problem\u201d that comes with \u201chuge economic costs,\u201d rather than wholesale risk to life and limb. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not a serious risk \u2014 it\u2019s a risk to well-being and wealth,\u201d he said. Overall, he said a greater danger for European countries is one of technological irrelevance. \u201cThere is remarkably little indigenous tech in Europe. Europe does need more tech self-sufficiency. We don\u2019t get that by writing strategies. We get that by companies growing up and solving problems,\" he said, adding that he is joining Paladin due to its interest in investing in European tech firms. As a parting shot, he had this to say about Europeans who remain focused on digital surveillance by the U.S. and other Western countries: \"Seven years on from Snowden, the idea that Western intelligence services are a primary malevolent force on the internet is in my view objectively ridiculous.\" This article is part of POLITICO Pro\u2019s premium coverage of Cybersecurity and Data Protection.

{"_id": "587266261407195_2282657905201347", "content": "The US and Europe are on different paths to regulating artificial intelligence but need each other to take on China. Political leaders in the U.S. and Europe are becoming increasingly alarmed by China\u2019s use of artificial intelligence to track its people and engage in other authoritarian behavior. But so far, the long-time allies are not united over rules for the rapidly evolving technology. Europe will soon propose strict AI regulations as part of a push to wield greater influence over the world\u2019s emerging technologies. The U.S., which is home to the world\u2019s leading AI developers, has instead chosen to draw up voluntary guidelines shaped in part by industry. Officials on both sides of the Atlantic say those parallel tracks will need to converge to counterbalance Beijing\u2019s technological ambitions. Making that happen would requirethe allies to agree on regulations that protect civil liberties without hampering innovation. \u201cStrategically, both the U.S. and the EU are concerned about China, so they need a tech policy that acknowledges a very aggressive position that China has taken in AI,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Center on AI and Digital Policy at the Michael Dukakis Institute, a technology and leadership think tank in Boston. Elected officials in Europe and the U.S. began laying the groundwork on Monday at an EU parliamentary hearing. Representative Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), who has championed a U.S. national strategy on AI, asked her European counterparts during testimony to be \u201cnarrow and flexible\u201d while pushing ahead with their \u201cdesire to be the first to write regulations.\u201d The U.S. and Europe need to stand together as China seeks to write the global playbook, she added. \u201cNations that do not share our commitment to democratic values are racing to be the leaders in AI and set the rules for the world,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe cannot allow this to happen.\u201d AI is poised to help governments and industry achieve lofty goals.  Deploying it faster has economic advantages. It can monitor and mitigate emissions from manufacturing plants, and allow doctors to more quickly diagnose and develop new treatments for illnesses. In law enforcement and defense, AI-enabled software is already used to identify suspected criminals or target weapons on the battlefield. But consumer and civil rights advocates have already raised concerns about its potential to displace workers and threaten personal privacy \u2014 outcomesthey warn can have damaging consequences without the proper safeguards. The U.S. and Europe are beginning to address those side effects. Whether the allies develop complementary sets of rules that emphasize privacy and human rights \u2014 rules that industry groups caution shouldn\u2019t stifle innovation \u2014 could be key to balancing the approach taken by China. In a report released Monday , the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence outlined the stakes, finding the \u201cmagnitude of the technological opportunity coincides with a moment of strategic vulnerability.\u201d Working with Europe and other allies to develop AI rules and invest in research is essential to defense and economic prosperity in the face of a foe as powerful as China, the report concludes. China is pouring large sums of money into developing AI and has a key advantage over its rivals: large quantities of data, which is needed to train computer algorithms, and few restrictions on how the government can use it. Though China released its own ethical AI principles in 2019, technology has already been developed to facilitate mass surveillance and suppress minorities \u2014 authoritarian tools that are then exported to other countries, according to media reports . The U.S. and Europe are already at odds on other tech issues. They are renegotiating a thorny deal about how to transfer data across their borders and trying to figure out how to tax digital giants like Facebook and Google. But recent comments from President Joe Biden indicate that the U.S. is ready to collaborate on policies for \u201cdemocratic values.\u201d Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in February , Biden said that the \u201ctransatlantic alliance is back.\u201d \u201cWe must shape the rules that will govern the advance of technology and the norms of behavior in cyberspace, artificial intelligence, biotechnology so that they are used to lift people up, not used to pin them down,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression.\u201d The need to engage Europe on tech issues is urgent, even as the Biden administration grapples with the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic downturn. Europe has made clear in recent months that it plans to push ahead with its digital sovereignty agenda. There is already domestic pressure brewing from industry groups and tech-minded members of Congress. Without U.S. input, they fear Europe could again set the regulatory standards that U.S. companies follow around the world \u2014 much as it has done in recent years with privacy rules for consumer data. The European Union\u2019s executive arm will release its proposal for AI regulation in April, and has lobbied hard for its vision for ethical artificial intelligence that would offer an alternative to the American and Chinese approaches to the technology. The EU\u2019s new law will set strict rules for AI applications that are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d and the bloc is mulling who to hold accountable when AI goes awry. Though Europe is not actually home to any of the world's largest technology companies, the continent nevertheless celebrates its role as a regulatory powerhouse. The strict privacy rules it implemented in 2018, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, have been broadly adopted by U.S. companies and become a blueprint for similar laws in California and countries around the world. European lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups don\u2019t want to relinquish that role. But EU digital czar Margrethe Vestager told POLITICO that \u201cthe rest of the world is catching up\u201d with the need to regulate technologies like artificial intelligence. She pointed to the international effort to develop an AI policy framework at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a potential starting point. \u201cThere\u2019s an understanding that we want to make the most of artificial intelligence, but we want people to trust the technology, too,\u201d she said. Luis Viegas Cardoso, a technology adviser to European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, has described Europe\u2019s approach to AI regulation as a \u201cthird way\u201d between the U.S. and China. But Europe forging its own path toward digital sovereignty doesn\u2019t diminish potential partnerships, he said in January . Indeed, the Commission sees the Biden administration as being open to the bloc\u2019s message about AI rules that respect human rights, inclusion and data protection, and wants to establish a \u201ctransatlantic accord\u201d on artificial intelligence. \u201cWe cannot ignore the simple fact that we have each other. The U.S. and the EU are big global like-minded actors,\u201d said Drago\u0219 Tudorache, a liberal member of the European Parliament and chair of its Special Committee on AI in the Digital Age. EU officials are likely to find willing partners in Congress, particularly among the new Democratic majority, whose members have pushed in recent years to curtail the use of AI by government agencies and law enforcement. Representatives Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.) and Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio), leaders of the House AI Caucus, met with Tudorache and Miapetra Kumpula-Natri, the first vice chair of the European Parliament\u2019s AI committee, in December. McNerney told POLITICO he came away from the talks bullish that both governing bodies can find common ground. He added that the Biden administration must find room for AI regulation among its competing priorities as the rest of the world hammers out its own approach. \u201cFor the U.S. to be a world leader on AI, we need to give this area of policy the significant attention it deserves,\u201d McNerney said. Congress took its boldest step yet in January when it passed legislation, H.R. 6395 (116), that instructed the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a federal agency known for its technology expertise, to develop guidelines for companies that reduce risks associated with AI. The law also establishes a National AI Initiative Office to develop and implement the U.S. approach to the technology.It also sets upan AI advisory committee composed of academics and industry officials who can suggest areas where the U.S. should collaborate with allies. U.S. technology companies are optimistic on the framework, seeing it as an opportunity for the American government to offer guidance without imposing onerous rules that could hamper future uses of AI. It could also help to avoid a repeat of ceding ground on data privacy rules, wherethe U.S. severely lags Europe in shaping global standards. \u201cIf the United States can avoid being flat-footed the way it was on privacy while Europe moves forward, and if it can lean more in, I think that creates a better political environment between the U.S. and Europe,\u201d said Craig Albright, the vice president of legislative strategy for BSA | The Software Alliance, a trade group with footprints in Washington and Brussels. That\u2019s becoming increasingly important as the U.S. and Europe are not running the technology race alone. Ultimately, concerns about China\u2019s growing technological ambitions, as well as reports of its government using AI for mass surveillance and human rights abuses, could push the U.S. and EU closer together. \u201cChina is trying to steer countries in a direction that is different than what the United States and Europe are trying to go towards,\u201d Albright said. When it comes to EU-U.S. relations, he added, \u201cI think you'll have a new administration that wants to leverage that point and wants to build on that point in a way that the [Trump] administration just didn't really care about.\u201d Mark Scott contributed to this report.

{"_id": "587266261407195_2292063450927459", "content": "As the EU gets ready to introduce a bloc-wide scheme, Estonia has been there, done that. As the EU prepares to unveil plans for a digital ID in April , privacy campaigners will be ready to pounce on a scheme to equip hundreds of millions of Europeans with unique online identifiers. Will it end online anonymity? Will it expose our data to hackers? Good thing Estonia is ready to answer their questions. For the past 20 years, citizens in the ultra-wired Baltic country have been able to do everything from banking to starting a business to managing health appointments via their digital ID. Issued at birth and good for life, Estonia\u2019s digital ID is a unique digital document which allows people to securely log on to private and public websites, removing the need for extra checks on their identity. Ninety-nine percent of people in the 1.3-million-strong country have one and, so far, the scheme has proved remarkably uncontroversial. \u201cI would say that we definitely have less emphasis on privacy, less emphasis on fighting against the government,\u201d said Estonian Social Democratic Party politician and internet freedom campaigner Siim Tuisk. Back when the digital ID system was first introduced, \u201cwe didn't really care about privacy,\u201d he added. That may be because Estonians are accustomed to carrying out many of life\u2019s activities digitally. A mantra in the country has it that the only things people can\u2019t do online is get married or divorced, and buy property. It also helps that the system\u2019s designers have built in safeguards against exploitation, protecting it from an aggressive and cyber-savvy Russian neighbor: The system is decentralized, denying hackers a single point of attack, and individuals are able to see who their data has been accessed by as well as when and why \u2014 unless the request came from law enforcement, in which case they\u2019ll be notified when the investigation is wrapped up. The upside is convenience and, according to one study from McKinsey Global Institute, an economic boost: Countries that implement a digital ID scheme can boost their gross domestic product by 3 to 13 percent by 2030. \u201cCome on,\" tweeted former Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves, reacting to news that the Commission was mulling over its plan. \"Estonia has had a secure Digital Identity in place for 20 years ... Does the Commission want Europe to be able to compete or not?\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean Estonia\u2019s scheme has been without hiccups \u2014 nor that it could be easily reproduced in other EU countries. Most recently, the country\u2019s Data Protection Inspectorate threatened a \u20ac100,000 penalty on three pharmacy chains that let individuals view another person\u2019s e-prescriptions without their consent by misusing their digital IDs. The offence violated Europe's privacy code, the GDPR . In August 2020, an Estonian police officer and health care professional were revealed to have violated the same rules when they tried to access information from the e-health system about the officer\u2019s future spouse without legal basis. The officer was fined \u20ac48 euros; the health care worker, \u20ac56. (It's unclear if the wedding went ahead.) \u201cThe point is that it came out,\u201d Estonia\u2019s Chief Legal Officer of the Government\u2019s Information Office Sten Tikerpe said. \u201cIf it had been an old school traditional system with a physical cabinet in the room, we would have never figured it out.\u201d That sort of explanation works well in Estonia, where trust in government is high and society is heavily digitized. It may prove a harder sell in privacy-obsessed Germany or even in France, where the country's data regulator issued a warning to a public authority over its COVID-19 tracing app. For example in Switzerland, which isn't in the EU but shares concerns about privacy, a proposal for a national digital ID system was voted down earlier this week over security concerns. Thomas Lohninger, executive director of the digital rights NGO epicenter.works, concedes that there are \"obvious benefits\" to the Commission's proposal. But he wants answers on the safeguards the Commission is considering to deal with the potential issues \u2014 and how (or if) \"pseudonymity\" will be assured through any EU-wide system. \"I want the architecture of the system to reassure me when it comes to security and privacy,\" he added. \"I want the possibility to deep-dive into the source code, to really understand the system.\" The high degree of sensitivity to privacy and surveillance in many EU countries may explain why the Commission has so far been cagey about the exact shape of its plans. Brussels is still wavering between different options for rolling out its scheme: Implementing a new digital ID system, strengthening existing legislation or requiring digital identification systems to comply with the bloc's eSignature Directive , which focuses narrowly on allowing electronic signatures to replace handwritten ones, are all options on the table, according to a presentation dated January 7 . (In every case, the digital ID would be rolled out by national authorities in each member country rather than by the EU itself.) Still, the EU has already taken a few steps in the direction of a digital ID. The Electronic Identification And Trust Services (eIDAS) regulation, which came into force in 2018, is designed to encourage the implementation of national digital IDs, enabling cross-border electronic transactions and electronic signatures. But only 14 out of 27 member countries have introduced online authentication systems, with only 55 percent of the bloc\u2019s population having access to one, according to another Commission presentation from September last year. \u201cEurope needs to speed up on eID,\u201d former Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip \u2014 who is Estonian \u2014 grumbled in a statement at the time. Three years later, wired Estonians are skeptical as to whether the rest of the EU can catch up to them on digital IDs, or if they even want to. \u201cI\u2019m not too optimistic about the Commission\u2019s proposal,\u201d said Tuisk, the Estonian politician, adding that high levels of mistrust in political elites in many EU countries will make the digital ID a tough sell. His countryman Tikerpe is more optimistic. With enough transparency and preparation, even the most digitally-skeptic factions can be brought on board. \u201cEven taking into account all the factors of global politics, it is still possible to build a perfectly transparent system,\u201d he said.", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "What Estonia\u2019s digital ID scheme can teach Europe"}

{"_id": "587266261407195_1973595302774277", "content": "POLITICO explores the impacts of the pandemic on daily life, democracy and the EU. The world we knew before COVID-19 is gone. The one that comes after is still at least partly up to us. The crisis has put entire countries under lockdown, devastated countless businesses, killed hundreds of thousands of people and upended hundreds of millions, if not billions, of lives. The question now: What comes next? As the world begins to look at what it will be like to live life with the coronavirus \u2014 or the threat of future outbreaks \u2014 it\u2019s already clear that the pandemic has the potential to disrupt industries, accelerate cultural and economic trends, or be used by policymakers or advocates gunning for transformative agendas. POLITICO journalists asked dozens of experts and policymakers what they believe the epidemic will \u2014 or, in their view, should \u2014 change. Here are their answers. The commercial real estate market stands to take a serious hit because of the coronavirus crisis. Many businesses are not expected to reopen once the crisis passes \u2014 leaving much unoccupied office space. Others may allow their employees to continue working from home and opt to save cash by taking advantage of more flexible co-working spaces. Despite occasional frustrations that come with remote working, managers in some industries have discovered how practical videoconferencing can be. \"It\u2019s much more effective than having hundreds of meeting[s],\" said Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, \"only now people realize how easy it is to use them.\u201d Hubertus Heil, Germany's labor minister, is drafting a law to give people the right to work from home even after the crisis . According to consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics , two years from now up to 30 percent of workers could be working from home multiple days per week. The vacated commercial spaces may be of use to cities like Madrid, Rome and Amsterdam, which for years have struggled with a housing crisis and rising residential rents. Even offices that continue to function will have to adjust in order to prepare for the pandemics that scientists cited by the World Economic Forum predict will be increasingly common in the future because of globalization and climate change. Paternoster lifts and \u201c Shabbat elevators \u201d \u2014 which run without anyone having to press germ-covered buttons \u2014 could become more common, and office spaces are likely to be more spaced out, as evidenced by examples like the Six Feet Office developed by real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield. \u2014 Aitor Hern\u00e1ndez-Morales It's hard to imagine Europe not returning to its culture of eating out and open-air caf\u00e9s. But even when the lockdowns are over, the experience of China shows that people are very reluctant to return to dining out. According to Adrian Cummins, a board member of HOTREC, a hospitality trade body, it will take some time before the situation for restaurants returns to anywhere near how things were before the lockdowns. \"What we need to do in our sector now, which is the most important thing, is we need to restore confidence,\" he said. \"We need to make sure that consumers are confident that going to a restaurant is a right thing.\" In China, the restaurants that have reopened have had to introduce extra safety measures : masks for staff, sufficient spacing between tables, and temperature checks. Similar measures could soon be introduced in Europe, which may make it hard for restaurants that make it through the immediate crisis to operate. Spacing out diners inevitably means fewer covers \u2014 and that could be enough to kill off many businesses. Even if consumers want to eat out, they might find their favorite places are gone. Cummins estimates that in Ireland, where he lives, 40-50 percent of restaurants might not reopen. That is why, he says, the European Commission and national governments should help businesses with non-refundable grant aid or zero-percent loans. \u2014 Zosia Wanat One of the first tangible impacts of the coronavirus that most Europeans witnessed outside hospitals was the panic-buying and empty shelves fueled by fears of shortages. Later, national border restrictions made it hard for truckers to transport goods across countries and for seasonal farmworkers to harvest fields . Some argue the crisis should prompt profound reflection on the relationship between Europeans and our food, from what we're eating now under lockdown , to what we should be eating when it's all over \u2014 as well as where it comes from. The European Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski argues that one of the main lessons is that Europe needs to grow its own crops, so it depends less on outside sources and bolsters the bloc's own food security. \u201cWe have to have our own food, produced on our fields, by our own farmers, and we have to take better care of local markets, shorten those supply chains,\u201d he said in an interview with POLITICO . Farming is already heavily subsidized by the Common Agricultural Policy, and the bloc is a net food exporter. But within the EU, the food supply in some individual countries is reliant on transportation and workers from abroad. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no doubt in my mind that there\u2019ll be more and more calls for re-localized, 're-territorialized' food systems,\u201d said Olivier De Schutter, co-chair of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems. \"Never before has there been such an incredible interest in short supply chains,\u201d he added. De Schutter said the EU could improve some of its policies \u2014 on public procurement, competition, the CAP scheme and its nascent Farm to Fork strategy to improve sustainability \u2014 to give advantages to local, smaller and organic farmers. \u2014 Zosia Wanat The crisis has also changed consumers' relationship with their food. National lockdowns and restaurant closures have nudged Europeans into their kitchens to bake bread and banana cake and more interesting evening meals. Many are also choosing the closest grocer to them, instead of opting for shopping at big supermarkets. According to a YouGov survey conducted at the beginning of April, 42 percent of British people said they value food more than they did before the crisis, 38 percent reported cooking more often from scratch, and 33 percent said they throw away less food. The poll also showed a clear majority wanted to see at least some of the personal or social changes they have experienced over the last month continue. \"Our expectation is that hopefully the consumers are going to regain some of the respect for food that previous generations had,\" said Mette Lykke, the CEO of Too Good To Go, an app that aims to reduce food waste. \"For a long time, we haven\u2019t really appreciated the true value of our food; we\u2019ve just taken it for granted. \"[Most people] have actually realized that we can live in a quite different way and still be pretty well off,\" Lykke said, adding that consumers might turn to better-quality food. \"A lot of this stuff we used to buy, we might not necessarily be interested in anymore.\" The pandemic has led to a surge in demand for organic and sustainable foods, according to Ecovia Intelligence, a research company. In France, for example, some organic food shops are reporting sales increases of over 40 percent. \u2014 Zosia Wanat The coronavirus crisis has divided workers into two classes: those who can work from home, and those forced to risk infection. While online platforms such as Uber and Deliveroo argue that their model offers people flexibility and control over their earnings, the crisis has shown how little freedom workers really have. The digital proletariat \u2014 those working for food-delivery, ride-hailing and e-commerce platforms \u2014 have little choice but to show up in order to serve remote customers. \u201cThe myth of the empowered gig economy worker has been fatally wounded by the COVID-19 crisis,\u201d said Nicola Countouris, professor of labor law at University College London. Governments will have to rethink social protections and labor rights for new kinds of work, especially as the newly laid-off turn to platforms for income. \u201cThere is going to be an increase of online work, but it won\u2019t all be of good quality and with enough protection, especially not in times of shock,\u201d said Anna Thomas, director of the Institute for the Future of Work. As the number of precarious workers grows, policy debates will heat up around how gig worker should be classified and support for policies like a universal basic income may gain traction, Thomas said. Spain has announced it is rolling out universal basic income permanently . If it succeeds, others may follow. Gig economy companies have been adamant that their workers should not be classed as \"employees.\" That means that many are not entitled to employee protection from the state, nor to bailouts for businesses offered to help them weather the crisis. Once COVID-19 subsides, that will be harder to sustain. \u2014 Melissa Heikkil\u00e4 With consumers too scared to leave their homes to shop for groceries, retailers have had no choice but to go online. Some of them, like Britain's Tesco or Belgium's Delhaize, already had online platforms, while others have had to get creative. France's Carrefour teamed up with UberEats to boost its delivery service, while Poland's biggest retailer Biedronka started to partner with the Spanish startup Glovo to deliver food to customers' doorsteps. Some smaller stores, such as the Parisian organic shop Kilogramme, built their own e-commerce services within 24 hours. This trend will continue when the crisis is over, said Christian Verschueren, director general of EuroCommerce, a trade body. \"If we learned one thing through this [crisis, it] is that digital transformation has been accelerated and will be accelerated,\" he said. \"People who have never gone online for their groceries have now started to go online for groceries,\u201d he added. \u201cI think all food retailers have seen an increase in e-commerce, and I think that will definitely not go away.\" Could that mean supermarkets as we know them will disappear, or will be run by machines? In the U.S., Amazon's technology for cashier-free shops is becoming increasingly popular, but in Europe the change might not come that fast. Verschueren said the robotization of retail on the Continent will continue \u2014 think more contactless payment options and self-checkouts to reduce opportunities to transmit the virus \u2014 but the technology can't totally replace human workers, especially in times of crisis. \"Even with the best artificial intelligence and the best robotization, I don\u2019t think the sector would have been able to deal better with the supply, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s actually the human invention and the human resilience that was able to cope with an increasing demand,\" he said. \u2014 Zosia Wanat Will bicycles rule the post-corona city? Campaigners and local officials hope so. From Berlin to Bogot\u00e1, and Vancouver to Milan , cities are already taking steps to broaden bike lanes to allow people to cycle while keeping a safe social distance from others. City residents are also enjoying the cleaner air from a massive drop in city traffic \u2014 a feature of lockdown life they may want to retain after restrictions begin to ease. \u201cMoving around on bike or on foot is \u2026 the only real pandemic-resilient mobility there is,\u201d a coalition of activists wrote in an open letter to German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer earlier this month. Urban mobility is a zero-sum game: The more space is given to cyclists, the more restrictions need to be imposed on cars. With vehicle traffic suppressed, campaigners see an opportunity to make a shift to two-wheeled transport, although it remains to be seen whether commuters will stay out of their cars once confinement restrictions are lifted \u2014 particularly if they are nervous about public transport. In Brussels, authorities are moving to impose a 20-kilometer-per-hour speed limit on motor vehicles within the congested center to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians. \u201cThe changes have to be permanent to be an improvement,\u201d said Morten Kabell, a former mayor for environmental affairs in Copenhagen and co-CEO of the European Cyclists\u2019 Federation. \u201cWider and more bicycle lanes can transport more people than car lanes can \u2026 and it\u2019s cheaper to build bike infrastructure.\u201d Spain\u2019s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, has backed efforts to shift transport infrastructure, while France\u2019s environment minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, has said she\u2019s making cash available for cities to extend cycling paths during the pandemic. Campaigners across Germany are calling for wider bike lanes, strict speed limits and \u201clarger, car-free shared spaces.\u201d They also want to turn entire neighborhoods into bike-only zones. In an effort to create more public space for people to walk around without being crammed on narrow sidewalks, Vienna has banned cars on some streets to create new \u201cmeeting zones\u201d instead. \u2014 Kalina Oroschakoff and Josh Posaner \"Think global, act local\" has long been the mantra of the environmental and social justice movements. The coronavirus crisis might help trigger its broader adoption, and change cities in the process. The ongoing lockdown has expanded our digital and local lives while contracting physical and global ones. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, argued in the Economist that the trend will continue. \"Even afterward, local resilience will be prized over global efficiency,\" he wrote. City officials and campaigners are already pushing for a rethink of urban planning, to reclaim public space and improve local living. Months before the appearance of the coronavirus, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo made the concept of the \u201c 15-minute city \u201d a pillar of her reelection campaign. The Socialist proposed turning the French capital into a collective of self-sufficient communities with everything \u2014 groceries, parks, gyms, health centers, schools and workplaces \u2014 just a 15-minute walk away from every resident\u2019s doorstep. COVID-19-related restrictions have inadvertently turned Hidalgo\u2019s plan \u2014 which was meant to reduce the pollution and stress created by daily commutes \u2014 into a reality, with Parisians forbidden under most circumstances to stray more than 1 kilometer from their homes. It would not be the first time that a crisis was used to revolutionize urban planning in Europe: Lisbon\u2019s utilitarian grid layout was developed as the Marquis of Pombal sought to rebuild the Portuguese capital after a devastating 1755 earthquake. Fathers of the \u201cRed Vienna\u201d city sought to address the housing crisis created by post-WWI urban migration by building grand self-sufficient living communities, exemplified by Karl-Marx Hof , a massive, housing complex that contains schools, health clinics, athletic infrastructure, gardens, beauty salons and shops. \u2014 Kalina Oroschakoff and Aitor Hern\u00e1ndez-Morales The global health crisis is accelerating a shift away from cash payments for public transport. Bus drivers in Berlin and London, for example, are now sealed in their cabins, and tickets can no longer be bought on board. That's accelerated the shift to app-based ticketing systems. And where physical ticket controls have vanished completely, some travelers are enjoying (effectively) free transit. Even once things start to gradually return to normal, decreased use of public transport will mean services will run way beneath profitability. Local authorities will have to provide major subsidies to maintain transport links, or risk the mothballing of tram and subway routes. Even before the pandemic, authorities in places such as Luxembourg and Vienna had already moved to make public transport free (or heavily discounted to \u20ac1 per day) as part of efforts to get cars off the road. Other transit changes will be more subtle, but are likely to stick. For example, carriage doors now open automatically on many subway systems, with messages for commuters to avoid regular touch points such as handles that could spread the infection. To counter fears of contagion, Transport for London, the authority that manages and regulates the U.K. capital\u2019s transport network, has promised to deploy long-lasting anti-viral cleaning fluids. \u2014 Josh Posaner Videoconferencing has taken the place of face-to-face meetings (and air miles that come with them) as big companies like Facebook, Rio Tinto and BP froze travel even before government lockdowns shuttered their employees at home. The longer that continues, the less likely that the old corporate travel bonanza is to return. Companies will be able to evaluate closely how productivity under lockdown compares \u2014 and whether the millions spent on corporate travel are really worth it. With the future uncertain, Facebook has ruled out holding events with more than 50 people until at least June 2021 and has banned business travel until at least June this year. Others may follow suit. Airlines are noticing. The airline lobby IATA is generally bullish when it comes to travel demand, but even its chief economist, Brian Pearce, admitted the forced break from air travel could change habits . \"If we see a bigger increase in videoconferencing technology as a substitute for business meetings, there is a possibility people might shun long-haul,\" he said. Airlines who had built their brand around adding \"a personal touch\" might have to rethink that too. Once the crisis subsides, leisure travel may not be the same either. Under lockdown, people are staying closer to home, and it\u2019s unclear whether holidaymakers \u2014 nervous about what they might catch \u2014 will be itching to get on a plane once restrictions are lifted. Nearby locations tend to be cheaper, and getting somewhere by car is less risky, at least from an infectious disease point of view, than being packed in a plane. Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary says he will counter that thinking with a blitz of low ticket prices. He predicts that families cooped up in their homes will be desperate to fly once the shackles are off. His competitors have taken a more conservative line. Many have deferred plane deliveries, believing it will take years before air travel returns to pre-pandemic levels. \u2014 Saim Saeed Airports have long been countries' gatekeepers, but the pandemic may require them to be de facto doctors too. Since the pandemic hit, numerous countries have installed facilities including temperature checks and COVID-19 testing equipment in terminals to screen passengers. Fears of a second wave of the disease or some future pathogen mean those facilities might remain for longer than the outbreak itself. In some cases, airlines themselves are testing passengers for the disease. The need for social distancing will also present challenges. Maintaining that in lines at security and immigration will require more space and different layouts. Passengers are also likely to find that they will encounter fewer staff while passing through security and into their plane, so as to minimize infection risk. Design changes will also mean fewer opportunities to pick up an infection by touching surfaces. That means more cleaning, no check-in screens and more contactless security and identification checks. The development of facial recognition technologies, long in the works, could be expedited to track passengers through the airport and reduce the need for physical checks \u2014 though such measures would come with privacy and surveillance concerns. With a predicted recession and demand in free fall, companies and policymakers are also considering shelving airport expansion plans. \"Returning as quickly as possible to full operational capabilities under a 'new normal' ... will involve new requirements for our staff, facilities, services and processes,\" said lobby group ACI-Europe's Director General Olivier Jankovec. \"Understanding what these requirements will be and shaping them is of crucial importance, as well as addressing longer-term impacts on a full range of issues \u2014 from airport layout and equipment to our economic and business models.\" \u2014 Saim Saeed In times of crisis, people typically turn to government authorities for help. With COVID-19, they've also turned to Big Tech. Facebook has teamed up with national public health agencies to keep people informed; Google has peppered search results with the latest updates on how to keep safe; Amazon has become an arm of many countries' postal services, as people rely on the e-commerce giant for everything from groceries to toilet paper. That trend \u2014 of treating some of Silicon Valley's biggest names as de facto public utilities \u2014 will not ebb as the number of global fatalities linked to the coronavirus eventually subsides. By providing up-to-the-minute advice, guidance and logistics, these companies have cemented themselves in public life even more so than they had done pre-COVID-19. Pulling back from that will be difficult, if not impossible. The consequences are likely to be felt across society. Regular interactions with government agencies and other public bodies will often also involve Big Tech. Think a national tax authority providing updates on WhatsApp, or Amazon delivering medical supplies to the elderly on behalf of a public heath agency. The lines between public bodies and these private companies will become blurred. The effects of labeling Big Tech as public utilities could go two ways. It may cement their position in society, driving off competitors and making them quasi-equals to government agencies. Or it may force regulators to clamp down on their activities, limiting their revenue sources as is done with other public utilities. Much will depend on how these companies perform during the crisis \u2014 and how governments react in the aftermath. \u2014 Mark Scott \"Many short-term emergency measures will become a fixture of life. That is the nature of emergencies. They fast-forward historical processes,\" wrote Israeli philosopher Yuval Noah Harari in late March , as the West woke up to the fact that it too would have to deal with a deadly disease that many thought would remain far away. For democracies that hold fundamental rights dear, that has meant some painful soul-searching as governments have turned to phone tracking and other surveillance measures to tame the outbreak. Officials have trotted out reassurances \u2014 that these are extraordinary times, and that intrusive technology deployed now will be wound down once the crisis is over \u2014 but many fear the genie is now out of the bottle. As the EU's data protection supervisor Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski said at a webinar recently: \u201cIf we create the system of tracking \u2026 it will stay here.\" Even if we decide we want to \"come back to the world without the contact tracing, without the location tracking, the weapons, the tools will be around anyway,\" he added. \u2014 Vincent Manancourt Europe's initial response to the coronavirus looked chaotic and uncoordinated: flight bans, border closures and blocks on exports of protective gear by national capitals that weren't talking to each other. Brussels was a sideshow because it does not have much power over health matters. \u201cThe truth is that when it comes to public health, the Union has done what its member nations wanted it to do: not much,\u201d public health expert Scott Greer wrote in the New York Times . But what if the EU could lay down the law \u2014 literally? The crisis has convinced many that the current setup doesn't work. More than 6,000 people, including former prime ministers, commissioners and a Parliament president, signed a petition arguing that it is time to make health a shared EU competence, and give the bloc the ability to act as a federal state in health emergencies. Providing Brussels with more health competence \u2014 in some form at least \u2014 has also been backed by French President Emmanuel Macron and some current commissioners. Under the health federalists\u2019 vision, Brussels could have acted earlier and more decisively by activating an EU-wide plan to harmonize testing and unify lockdown strategies. It would have been able to purchase masses of protective gear from the outset. (It took weeks after a health ministers meeting before the EU launched its first procurement effort.) Brussels could have played air-traffic controller: moving medical staff to countries harder hit, and patients to countries with a greater capacity to treat them. Such measures would mean a massive increase in power, which in turn would mean reopening EU treaties \u2014 an idea that strikes fear into the heart of even the most committed Europhile. But with scientists predicting the arrival of future pandemics, it could prove essential. \u2014 Jillian Deutsch The idea of an entirely digital European Parliament now doesn't looks so crazy. \u201cThis crisis is showing everybody that the digital world has arrived,\u201d said Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez Pons, a Spanish MEP and vice president of the conservative European People\u2019s Party. \u201cWe are at the beginning of the digital Parliament.\u201d In March, Parliament President David Sassoli canceled all plenary sessions in Strasbourg until July , advised MEPs to work remotely and later introduced online voting and virtual committee meetings. The measures were unprecedented. Gonz\u00e1lez Pons said that the need for MEPs to spend money on travel could be re-examined in the future, although scrapping trips to Strasbourg is \u201canother issue,\" he said, as \u201cwe are obliged by the treaties.\u201d Other MEPs saw the experience of going entirely digital as a way to improve their relationship with the outside world. Nathalie Loiseau, a French MEP from the centrist Renew Europe group, said she will participate in a videoconference with MPs in France, \u201csomething we had struggled to put in place in normal times.\u201d Daniel Freund, a Green MEP from Germany, said he had organized webinars on EU-related themes \u201calmost every day\u201d since the lockdown started. But for many, tech solutions are no substitute for face-to-face business. \u201cTechnical solutions do by no means replace physical meetings and social interaction,\u201d said German Socialist MEP Gabriele Bischoff. Loiseau, who is also the chairwoman of the Parliament's Defense and Security Subcommittee, agrees. \u201cClearly, the work conditions were not optimal. Everything took twice more time, we had to call each other before a meeting to prepare, and after the meeting to debrief. It\u2019s much less interactive.\u201d \u2014 Ma\u00efa de La Baume The EU's geopolitical ambitions look increasingly likely to be a casualty of the crisis \u2014 at least in the short term. To bolster the EU's nascent military capabilities \u2014 and hence diplomatic clout \u2014 the Commission originally proposed that the next long-term EU budget include a European Defense Fund of \u20ac13 billion, to promote military cooperation, plus a separate off-budget European Peace Facility of \u20ac10.5 billion for military operations. But with economic survival now the priority \u2014 the International Monetary Fund expects the eurozone to contract by 7.5 percent this year \u2014 there will be urgent calls to put the bloc's money to other uses, diplomats say. \"In the short term ... in a moment of economic reconstruction, the last priority will be the military one,\u201d said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali, a Rome-based think tank, and a special adviser to European High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell. Geopolitical considerations will not be off the agenda forever though, she said. \"In the longer term, the theme will bounce back as the U.S. and China are on a [conflicting] path ... and it\u2019s increasingly clear that [it] is very expensive for us to be simply the battleground between the two superpowers,\u201d said Tocci. EU leaders stressed the bloc's \"strategic autonomy\" in a joint statement following their first virtual meeting in March shortly after lockdowns were imposed across Europe. That means the EU's ability to protect key assets and the goal of becoming less economically dependent on external actors such as China. \u201cWhat we have understood is that first we need to be less dependent and to have our economy back on track, then we can really play a role as a geopolitical actor,\u201d argued a senior EU diplomat. Others are less optimistic and say that with 27 different interests to reconcile, the goal of strategic autonomy \"could take decades to become real\u201d according to a second senior EU diplomat. \u2014 Jacopo Barigazzi Since creating the euro, European leaders have dreamed that their shared currency will one day rival the almighty dollar. The previous European Commission drew up a battle plan to use the euro as a counter to the U.S., whose stranglehold over dollar-denominated trade in commodities like oil lets it run unilateral policies such as sanctions on Iran \u2014 and impose fines on EU banks for violating them. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has also taken up the challenge, mandating Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis to make the euro a \u201cstrategic asset for our Union.\u201d \u201cThis will include increasing the global use of the euro for payments, as a reserve currency and for debt issuance,\u201d she wrote in his mission letter. For that to happen, however, Europe will need strong economic growth, said Guntram Wolf, the director of the Brussels think tank Bruegel. Instead, the Continent is on course for its biggest decline since the Great Depression . \u201cNo one wants to invest in your economy if there\u2019s no growth,\u201d Wolf said, stressing the importance of the EU crafting an economic recovery fund. \u201cThe growth story is really, really important.\u201d Even if growth comes back strong, the euro club is lacking a safe asset for investors to buy, equivalent to U.S. Treasury securities. Northern European countries have repeatedly spurned the idea of shared euro bonds for fear that their taxpayers would be on the hook for the debt of supposedly profligate southern countries. If the crisis doesn't end up breaking the euro , then there is hope, said Wolf. \u201cIf we can pick out a proper growth strategy and issue some joint debt, which would be sustainable on the side of stronger and weaker countries, then the EU can get out of the crisis strengthened \u2014 not weakened.\" \u2014 Bjarke Smith-Meyer One of the shared characteristics of the populist movements that, in their various incarnations, came to prominence in the past decade was a deliberate fostering of mistrust in established, academic, informed opinion. Who needs people who have studied a subject for years when you have a \u201c very stable genius \u201d in the White House? Or when the U.K. public has \u201c had enough of experts \u201d? The coronavirus may have changed that. It\u2019s not just the sight of some those same populist figureheads now being flanked by their expert officials at daily press conferences. Scientists warned for years that a pandemic like this was not only possible but probable. Politicians concerned with the daily cut and thrust did not pay enough attention. They will now. \u201cAfter the COVID crisis, it\u2019s reasonable,\u201d wrote former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney in the Economist , \u201cto expect people to demand \u2026 more heed to be given to the advice of scientific experts.\u201d In Carney\u2019s view, \u201cthe great test\u201d of whether a new attitude really prevails will be climate change \u2014 governments either mitigate in advance or people will suffer down the line. There is no social distancing from a heating climate. Frank Snowden, a history of medicine professor who specializes in how epidemics change society, agrees. \u201cIt seems to me essential, desirable and good economics, politics and morals to go about stimulating the economy in ways that are sustainable in the long term; a green economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would protect our planet and protect our health \u2014 and put people back to work.\u201d Who needs experts?

{"_id": "587266261407195_1553046484829163", "content": "Human-centered policy is needed to wrest control from China, tech giants. NEW YORK \u2014 The year is 2019. The technology that will determine the future of humanity is concentrated in the hands of just nine entities. Their decisions are not driven by what is good for you or me \u2014 but by market forces and authoritarian politics. This isn\u2019t the plot to a dystopian thriller from the 1980s. It\u2019s what\u2019s happening today. The future of artificial intelligence \u2014 and ours by extension \u2014 is already controlled by just nine tech titans \u2014 the companies that are developing the frameworks, chipsets and networks that underpin the communication infrastructure of modern society. They are the ones funding the majority of research and earning the lion\u2019s share of patents. And in the process, they are gaining access to our data in ways that aren\u2019t transparent or even observable. Six of these companies \u2014 Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM and Apple \u2014 are based in the U.S. The other three are operating in China: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Why is this worrying? In both countries, the high-stakes race for AI dominance is unfolding in ways that threaten to undermine the best interests of citizens across the world. The U.S. government has failed to devise an AI game plan. Instead of leveraging AI advances to build and strengthen our international alliances, or to prepare our military for the future of warfare, Washington has subjugated AI to the revolving door of politics. Instead of funding basic research into AI, it has effectively outsourced R&D to the commercial sector and the whims of Wall Street. This inattention threatens to scupper the U.S.\u2019s chances to ensure the new technology does not undermine democratic ideals. The Chinese government, meanwhile, is taking the opposite approach: It is pumping money into AI research as part of a strategy, launched in July 2017, to devote part of its sovereign wealth fund to new AI labs and establish itself as the world\u2019s AI leader . By the year 2030, it expects to have a domestic AI industry worth at least $150 billion. Beijing\u2019s AI push is part of a coordinated attempt by President Xi Jinping to turn China into the world\u2019s unchallenged AI hegemon, and to control and monitor its citizens . In China, AI underpins a series of national edicts and laws that aim to control all information generated within the country and to monitor the data of its residents as well as those of its various strategic partners. Beijing is also using AI to develop a Chinese-led cyberspace governance network and a new internet that would, in the words of Xi, \u201cspread positive information, uphold the correct political direction and guide public opinion and values towards the right direction.\u201d Why does this matter? A technologically dominant China would transform global trade, the internet, how we do business, and even how we travel. The authoritarian rules China would have us all live by are a divergence from the free speech, market-driven economy and distributed control that we cherish in the West. Xi\u2019s endgame is abundantly clear \u2014 to create a new world order in which China is the de facto leader. Were Xi\u2019s dream to become reality, the West\u2019s influence would wane, and it might be unable to protect its citizens from Beijing\u2019s surveillance and data collection. Beijing isn\u2019t going to back down. The U.S. \u2014 working with its democratic partners \u2014 urgently needs to play catch up and develop the strong, solid muscles it will need to win the AI race. Some in the West \u2014 and particularly in Europe \u2014 might be tempted to try to solve the problem with shared regulations and standards. That would be a mistake. In order for regulations to be effective, they have to be specific. But AI is progressing so fast that any regulations created in 2019 would be outdated by the time they went into effect. Instead, the U.S. should lead the way by founding a Global Alliance on Intelligence Augmentation \u2014 an international body dedicated to collaborate and set best practices for AI that would include researchers, sociologists, economists, game theorists, futurists and political scientists from across the world. China, too, should have a seat at the table. This may seem a tall order given the current political rancor and geopolitical uneasiness. But there is precedent: In the aftermath of World War II, when tensions were still high, hundreds of delegates from all Allied nations gathered together in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to build the financial structures that enabled the global economy to move forward. The result wasn\u2019t inflexible regulations, but standards and guardrails that could evolve over time. Collaboration was human-centered, and resulted in a future where people and nations could rebuild and seek out prosperity. This is what we need to move forward on AI. Western policymakers also need to start seeing tech titans as strategic partners, rather than enemies or competitors, and develop meaningful relationships with engineers working in Silicon Valley. AI will present us with challenges we cannot forsee. An adversarial relationship between tech companies and politicians will make it harder to address these. We\u2019re in the midst of an epochal change to a world in which AI \u2014 and very possibly, superintelligent machines \u2014 will be the biggest factor driving success or failure. We have to resist measures, such as restrictive regulations, that address immediate concerns at the expense of long-term progress and instead work toward setting AI on a course that upholds our democratic values. Amy Webb founded the Future Today Institute and is a professor of strategic foresight at the NYU Stern School of Business.

When the United Kingdom released its coronavirus app in early May on the Isle of Wight, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people testing the digital tracing tool were \"at the forefront of helping Britain get back on her feet.\" What a difference almost two months makes. On Thursday, London announced it had postponed the countrywide launch of its coronavirus app so that it could be overhauled to use technology provided by Google and Apple. The U-turn follows more than two months of technical glitches, questions about the apps' effectiveness, and doubts over whether people would even download it in the first place. \"We have agreed to share our own innovative work on estimating distance between app users with Google and Apple,\" Dido Harding, who chairs the U.K. government's test and trace program, and Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX, the innovation unit of the country's health service, said in a statement. \"Our ambition is to develop an app which will enable anyone with a smartphone to engage with every aspect of the NHS Test and Trace service.\" Harding and Gould did not give a date for when the country's revamped app would be released, though officials said the fall would be the most likely time frame. The decision represents a blow for Britain's efforts to show that it is at the forefront of tackling the global pandemic. Unlike other countries like Germany, and many U.S. states, London had decided initially not to work with Google and Apple, which would only allow access to their mobile phone technology to government apps that stored sensitive data on people's mobile devices. British officials, along with their counterparts in France, had balked at the American tech giants' demands that data should remain decentralized. They said it was preferable to collect people's information into one central server so that researchers could better analyze the spread of the disease. (Paris released its app in early June, though it has so far only been downloaded by a fraction of the country's population.) But now, amid ongoing technical problems, which have resulted in months of delays before the British app can be released nationwide, the U.K. has decided to fall in line with other countries and work with Google and Apple directly on its coronavirus digital tracing tool. Coronavirus apps use a device's bluetooth mobile technology to determine if someone has been in close contact with another person infected with the virus, so that people can be informed if they need to isolate themselves. British officials acknowledged that the country\u2019s standalone app had not been accurate in identifying if people had been in contact with someone who had the coronavirus. On devices using Google's Android operating system, for instance, the U.K. digital tool was 75 percent effective. But on Apple devices, that figure fell to a mere 4 percent. Coronavirus apps that relied on technology provided by the tech giants were accurate in 99 percent of instances, U.K. officials noted. Despite the setback, London may not be as far behind others in using smartphone apps to identify who has been infected with COVID-19. Other countries that have released their own apps have faced problems with not enough people downloading the digital tracing tools. Norway, for instance, paused its own app this week after only 14 percent of the population had signed up. Privacy campaigners also have warned against government surveillance by the back door if officials are allowed to use people\u2019s sensitive health data for purposes other than to combat COVID-19. Security experts have similarly raised questions about using bluetooth to identify who has been in touch with those infected by the coronavirus. Developers behind Italy's app said it is highly likely that these tools would lead to both false positives and negatives because of the inaccuracy of the mobile device technology. British officials also said that Google and Apple's solution is still not accurate enough to tell who has been in proximity with someone suffering from the virus, though countries like Germany, Spain and Ireland are still using their technology for their national apps. For now, the U.K. plans to rely on people to conduct so-called contact tracing, or calling those infected with the virus to determine whom they have been in contact with. That analogue system has had its own difficulties, with many people who had been contacted either not answering the tracers' calls or declining to say with whom they had been in contact. Currently, the U.K. has the third highest global death toll, at 42,200 people, behind the U.S. and Brazil, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University .", "source_name": "POLITICO Europe", "title": "UK postpones countrywide coronavirus app launch"}
{"_id": "471876160233_10163843021250234", "content": "Digitalisation is a race we are bound to lose if we do not move quickly. With digitalisation completely overhauling our infrastructure, workplaces and day-to-day life, getting ahead in developing and using modern technology is critical. In fact, our living standards and the prosperity and security of the entire continent depend on it. However, we are held back by bureaucracy and slow decision-making processes, while our competitors are rushing forward and do not play by the rules. Let us take Nuctech for example: the Chinese state-owned company supplies European airports with security technology such as body scanners. Through its dumping strategies, Nuctech\u2019s presence on the European market is growing rapidly, although the company provides the Chinese government with the security data it collects in our midst. The European Commission, while being aware of the problem, does not react fast enough for competition reasons, thus risking yet another big data surveillance scandal. The Nuctech example clearly illustrates how we are not only falling behind economically due to China\u2019s use of extremely low-pricing strategies on European markets, but also risking our national and European security. It is however only one, not even very prominent, example. German cities, for instance, are also buying their \u2018smart city\u2019 technology from Huawei because it is very advanced and very cheap. We are facing the same problem when it comes to 5G networks. As long as providers like Huawei stick to our rules, it will be very difficult to justify excluding them from European markets. Yet, it is very likely that the constant updating of 5G infrastructure will expose a huge security vulnerability, with massive amounts of data likely to be made available to the Chinese government. That is why we have to be more radical. The proposal from the European Commission to allocate \u20ac3bn in funding to digital infrastructure like 5G under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) should be considered just as a starting point. Rather, the Commission should follow up on its commitment to set comprehensive standards for any third country operator and strictly supervise their conduct. This must go beyond ethical provisions and involve setting binding rules and strict red lines when it comes to advanced technology, including common safeguards for products such as body scanners provided by Nuctech or infrastructure like 5G networks operated by Huawei. In addition, we need to support the 5G rollout by ensuring an investment-friendly environment for European providers that allows for fast, non-bureaucratic and cost-e cient network deployment. We need to provide fi nancial incentives for Member States and their communes to get 5G support that does not force them to opt for foreign solutions due to cost reasons and show that the administrative process is not a hurdle. Moreover, we need to ensure that a European 5G network is as cyber-resilient as possible. However, what we should collectively strive for is European digital sovereignty and a real European Digital Single Market. We need to be independent from foreign technology when it comes to critical infrastructure, which is a matter of national security. We need 5G \u201cMade in Europe.\u201d And we need to prioritise the development of certain technologies that we are already strong in and invest in those to get ahead of our competitors. The investment gap compared to China or the US is estimated at \u20ac190bn per year. Not a single one of the world\u2019s top 15 digital companies is European. There is no significant European browser, social media platform or search engine. We only have a few years to move forward before we will fall out of the race completely. What is still holding us back is the division of the Digital Single Market. We need to fi nally synchronise our national regulatory frameworks. European digital businesses are placed at a disadvantage, although only a strong European Digital Single Market can protect our interests. EU Member States should consider that in their positions, instead of blocking harmonisation. With a strategic plan, strong political will and large investments, Europe can still catch up in a secure manner.

{"_id": "471876160233_10164863628915234", "content": "WITH THE RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE FACILITY IN MIND, WHERE DO YOU SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED DIGITALISATION? Dharmendra Kanani: The health and economic crises will further focus the minds of governments and citizens to increase digitalisation in particular in health and education provision. Aligned to this will be the need to improve the accuracy, privacy and sharing of data. Ben Wreschner: The Recovery and Resilience Fund is the oil in the engine of recovery. However, early indications from the national recovery plans so far suggest insufficient focus on the policy reforms needed to drive digitalisation progress. A key challenge is that State Aid rules may currently restrict Member States from using recovery funds to accelerate 5G rollouts to rural areas. Progress may also be stifled by the fact that policy reforms to crowd-in private investment are lacking. We are sure Parliament will want to pay close attention to both these issues. In short, we are in a good place to start, but recovery funds must be coupled with the right legislative framework to enable digital and green investment in the right areas. DIGITAL AND GREEN ARE KEY PILLARS FOR OUR RECOVERY. HOW WILL CONNECTED EUROPE ENSURE STAKEHOLDERS REMAIN ON COURSE FOR IMPLEMENTING CHANGE IN THESE AREAS? Ben Wreschner: We know that digital has a major role to play in delivering the Green Deal. To achieve this, we need a proper monitoring framework. The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), if expanded to include the critical green agenda, is the best focus for those targets and measurement. Furthermore, the 20 percent digitalisation and 37 percent green targets will certainly help to ensure the Commission and Member States are held to account and implement the right policy reforms. Dharmendra Kanani: The European Commission and Members States are responsible for ensuring stakeholders remain on course through conditionality and scrutiny processes. Connected Europe enables an alternative, outside of government perspective to ensure the views of citizens and other stakeholders are at the heart of discussions on enabling a successful, green and resilient Europe. In this way, we are influencing and shaping the course of the Member States and the EU to ensure a digital and green recovery. ONE OF THE PARTICULAR FEATURES OF CONNECTED EUROPE IS THE ENGAGEMENT OF CITIZENS IN THE FORMATION OF DIGITALISATION RECOMMENDATIONS. SO FAR, WHAT HAS BEEN THE FEEDBACK FROM THIS AUDIENCE? Dharmendra Kanani: We\u2019ve been running a series of online focus groups with a diverse mix of over 250 citizens from 16 European countries. The feedback so far suggests that Europe could compete in the global digital arena as something of a \u2018premium\u2019 brand. Citizens want \u2018Made in Europe\u2019 to stand for quality, in terms of strict privacy and data protection, longer product lifespans, greater environmental sustainability and an emphasis on quality of life. They are also concerned about fairness and the digital divide, and many said they are willing to sacrifice a certain amount of privacy for convenience and cost as long as the result is greater quality. VODAFONE HAS PUBLICLY STATED ITS AMBITION FOR MEMBER STATES TO ACHIEVE 90 OUT OF 100 ON THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AND SOCIETY INDEX (DESI) BY 2027, IS THAT REALISTIC GIVEN WHERE COUNTRIES ARE RIGHT NOW? Ben Wreschner: It\u2019s challenging, but we believe a DESI score of 90 by 2027 is realistic. Frankly, it\u2019s something that we must make happen because the benefits of achieving it are so significant. The Deloitte report, Digitalisation: An Opportunity for Europe , has recently shown that achieving 90 on DESI could boost the European Union\u2019s GDP per capita by 7.2 percent \u2013 equivalent to a \u20ac1 trillion increase in overall GDP. Unsurprisingly, some Member States \u2013 typically those with low GDP per capita \u2013 have further to go than others, but the good news is that those same states stand to be the biggest beneficiaries. Now each Member State needs to develop national plans for meetings its own targets. LOOKING AHEAD TO 2030, WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO SEE IN THE AREA OF DIGITALISATION? Dharmendra Kanani: By 2030 we should have a data sharing protocol in place across Europe that underpins a fully functioning digital single market. We would have a digital EU-wide trading passport for business, an EU portal for qualifications and skills accreditation to facilitate better mobility and employability, online learning as a hybrid education and life learning model as well as a digital Erasmus for young people not in education and employment. Digital innovation and enterprise tax breaks would be commonplace, as would digital health passports and city-wide digital dashboards. Ben Wreschner: It\u2019s exciting to imagine a world where telemedicine would increase life expectancy and reduce health costs, smart cities would save energy, rural communities would be reinvigorated, and new jobs created. There is a digital dividend waiting for the citizens of Europe if we invest in digitalisation. The success of the Digital Decade and Europe\u2019s recovery depends on our collective efforts to maximise the impact of public and crowd-in private investment. That is why we formed this partnership with Friends of Europe and why we look forward to working with Members of the European Parliament to make the benefits of digitalisation a reality.

His comments came during a virtual debate on the issue, organised by the European Internet Forum (EIF), an independent, MEP-led forum specialising in digital policy issues. As part of EIF\u2019s \u2018Meet the CEO\u2019 series, MEPs, EIF members and guests have the opportunity to exchange views with key figures in industry. Mollenkopf heads Qualcomm, a world leading company of engineers, scientists and business strategists that invent breakthrough technologies aimed at transforming how the world connects, computes, and communicates. In his opening remarks, he voiced appreciation for the event on 9 September which, he said, came at a very important time. \u201dThe COVID-19 crisis has shown that the more access we have to powerful, flexible and secure networks, the more we can keep working, stay connected with our doctors and keep safe and protected, educate our children, and keep our economies growing and help them rebound and be even stronger than they were before\u201d. Moderated by EIF\u2019s Director General Maria Rosa Gibellini, participants were informed that the world was facing unprecedented challenges and that the aim therefore was to emerge from the crisis with an \u201cambitious boost to the economy and robust investments towards a green and digital future.\u201d Also participating in the hour-long online debate was veteran Spanish MEP Pilar del Castillo, chair of the EIF\u2019s Steering Committee. Both del Castillo and Mollenkopf agreed that 5G technology was key to delivering this ambitious economic boost. Rollout, which began in 2019, will bolster Europe\u2019s economic recovery and resilience. Mollenkopf recalled that when he was a young engineer, he spent a lot of time in Europe, particularly France and Germany, working on the rollout of 3G technology with some brilliant people. Two thirds of his company\u2019s employees are engineers and, according to him, \u201cIt is important that, despite the pandemic, we maintain the ability to collaborate with each other.\u201d He explained that Qualcomm partners closely with European players on developing and deploying wireless technology across nearly all industrial sectors in Europe, ranging from automotive and smart factories to agriculture and smart cities. \u201cPeople understand that the digital economy of the future is really going to build on the plumbing that 5G creates. And so, it is very important to encourage operators to put that plumbing into the ground so that business model experimentation on top of it can occur.\u201d He praised current efforts on 5G, saying that so far, rollout had been \u201cgood\u201d, with a total of 80 5G networks in 40 countries worldwide. Europe, he said, is \u201cdoing well\u201d, with 30 5G networks in 15 European countries. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think any region recognises the importance of standardised technology as much as Europe does.\u201d Mollenkopf explained, \u201cEuropean efforts to foster strategic autonomy are all about resilience, all about becoming stronger through industrial leadership: You\u2019re taking steps like becoming the leader in the deployment of 5G networks and taking advantage of 5G.\u201d Del Castillo \u201cwelcomed\u201d the opportunity to have an exchange of views with a leading CEO such as Mollenkopf, saying, \u201cThere are so many opportunities related to 5G and now is a major opportunity to accelerate and to move up a gear in the digital transformation.\u201d While the Coronavirus pandemic, was \u201cunique\u201d, she said it also \u201cillustrates what we need to do on the digitalisation front and the urgency with which we need to do it. It is crucial we show the added value of the EU\u2019s position.\u201d She paid tribute to Qualcomm which - del Castillo said - had been instrumental in the rollout of wireless technology. \u201cIt is playing an important role in the deployment of 5G\u201d. The crisis, she argued, has resulted in a \u201cdifferent\u201d world with both children and adults increasingly working from home and therefore dependent on connectivity. And, according to the senior Spanish EU policymaker, connectivity \u201cis instrumental in Europe\u2019s recovery from the crisis.\u201d However, for del Castillo, one question remains: how far away is Europe in deploying 5G and therefore realising its potential? She said she was optimistic but concluded by saying \u201cIt is clear we still have work ahead.\u201d", "source_name": "The Parliament Magazine", "title": "5G technology is key to Europe\u2019s Recovery"}
